  "thought": "**Analysis of Address Mapping for Vĩnh Long Province**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user is giving me an old Vietnamese address and wants the new equivalent, based on the recent administrative changes in Vĩnh Long. My first step is to *understand* the starting point: Xã Hiếu Nhơn, in Huyện Vũng Liêm, Vĩnh Long Province.  Vĩnh Long is the target province, and based on the prompt, we are only to determine the new ward, eliminating all considerations for district-level changes.\n\nThe game plan is straightforward: I need to analyze resolutions, essentially government directives, to find the new ward assignment for Hiếu Nhơn.\n\nFirst, I looked at the province level. Based on my expertise, I *know* about the significant provincial-level mergers and adjustments in recent years. I quickly referenced the provided resolution (60-NQ/TW), specifically the lists of provinces. Vĩnh Long wasn't mentioned in the \"no-merger\" list, which is expected. I then reviewed the merger list and *confirmed* that while there was a proposed merger of Vĩnh Long with Bến Tre and Trà Vinh, the name \"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\" actually remains, implying no change at this province level. That's good to clarify.\n\nNow, the crucial step: I need to dig into the details regarding *wards*, especially Hiếu Nhơn. I switched to the \"Other resolutions\" (1687/NQ-UBTVQH15) and scanned the lines carefully. I was specifically looking for any mentions of \"Hiếu Nhơn\".  Initially, I encountered a line that described the merger of other areas, but it didn't include Hiếu Nhơn.  Then, Eureka! Line 14 popped up and said exactly what I needed: *Hiếu Nhơn, Hiếu Nghĩa, and Hiếu Thành* would be merged into a new ward called *Hiếu Thành*. That's the golden ticket!\n\nKnowing \"Hiếu Nhơn\" becomes \"Hiếu Thành\", I looked through the *New wards* data. It didn't take long to find the perfect match: \"Xã Hiếu Thành\" with a ward code and the province of Vĩnh Long – perfect!\n\nSo, the conclusion is clear. The address from Xã Hiếu Nhơn, Vĩnh Long, now maps to Xã Hiếu Thành, Vĩnh Long. I'm confident about this mapping because the resolution explicitly addresses the merger. And the new ward data confirms everything. The JSON output will be straightforward and direct. Given this clear linkage and no ambiguities, I can confidently label this as a \"high\" confidence finding. This mapping is as robust as it gets.\n",
