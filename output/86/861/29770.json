  "thought": "**Vietnamese Administrative Unit Mapping - Analysis of Phường Cái Vồn**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. As an expert in Vietnamese administrative units, I've been tasked with pinpointing the current administrative status of the former ward, `Phường Cái Vồn` in `Thị xã Bình Minh`, `Tỉnh Vĩnh Long`. My process begins with a thorough analysis of available legal documents.\n\nFirst, I need to understand if `Tỉnh Vĩnh Long` underwent any boundary changes. The `60-NQ/TW` resolution on province mergers revealed that Vĩnh Long merged with Bến Tre and Trà Vinh, but the resulting province still retains the name `Vĩnh Long`. That's critical to know.\n\nNext, I diligently reviewed the provided resolutions to identify changes related to `Phường Cái Vồn`. I scanned through all listed resolutions to pinpoint any mentions of the target ward.\n\nMy focus quickly landed on resolution `1687/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which specifically addresses the administrative rearrangements within `Tỉnh Vĩnh Long`. Within this resolution, two key entries caught my attention:\n\n1.  One entry states that `phường Cái Vồn` contributes to the formation of a new ward named `phường Bình Minh`, implying a division of the original ward.\n2.  The next entry reveals that the *remaining part* of `phường Cái Vồn` (after being involved in the arrangement for the new `phường Bình Minh` in the previous point) will continue to exist, but is now merged with other units, to constitute a *new* ward also named `phường Cái Vồn`.\n\nBased on this analysis, it seems that `Phường Cái Vồn` is now divided into parts, one component of a new `phường Bình Minh`, and another section that, along with other units, forms a new ward retaining the name `Phường Cái Vồn`. This requires careful interpretation and further verification against any supplementary documentation to get a precise understanding of the current boundaries.\n",

The user wants me to pinpoint the updated administrative location for the address \\\"Phường Cái Vồn, Thị xã Bình Minh, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\" Here's how I'm breaking it down:\\n\\nFirst, I need to analyze the input address: \\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\" is the ward, \\\"Thị xã Bình Minh\\\" is the district (although I know districts are being reorganized), and \\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\" is the province.\\n\\nNext, I have to consider the provincial resolutions, specifically Resolution 60-NQ/TW. I know I have to check for mergers and changes. I reviewed the merged provinces, and I know that Vĩnh Long remains as is, even if the geographic boundaries change.\\n\\nThen, I'll dive into the other relevant resolutions for Vĩnh Long. I'm searching for mentions of \\\"Phường Cái Vồn,\\\" \\\"Thị xã Bình Minh,\\\" or \\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\" Resolution 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15 seems most relevant because it deals with reorganizing the wards in the province.\\n\\nWithin that resolution, two lines stood out:\\n1.  One indicated that a part of \\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\" and the entire \\\"Thuận An\\\" ward had been combined to create a new \\\"phường Bình Minh.\\\"\\n2.  The other noted that the *remaining* part of \\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\" after the first line's reorganization had been merged with another ward to create a *new* \\\"phường Cái Vồn.\\\"\\n\\nSo, I have two solid ward candidates:\\n1.  The newly created \\\"phường Bình Minh\\\".\\n2.  The *new* \\\"phường Cái Vồn.\\\"\\n\\nI'll check the \\\"New Wards\\\" list to find the \\\"ward_code\\\" associated with each. I found a match for \\\"phường Bình Minh\\\" with the code \\\"29771\\\". I also found a match for the new \\\"phường Cái Vồn\\\" with the code \\\"29770\\\".\\n\\nNow, I have to figure out which of those codes is the best match for the specific address. Based on the resolution, I'd say that either of the wards is a plausible match, but the final determination requires more data. I need to know which *part* of \\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\" the original address referred to, to know if it's \\\"29770\\\" or \\\"29771\\\".\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1687/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Vĩnh Long\",\n        \"line\": \"107.

The user's query involves mapping an old administrative address to its new equivalent. My initial approach is to consult the relevant resolutions and the list of updated wards.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I checked the province-level changes. Resolution 60-NQ/TW doesn't impact Vĩnh Long's status, so the province remains \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNext, I delved into the specific resolutions for Vĩnh Long, focusing on the relevant resolution number 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15. I identified two clauses within this resolution that are pertinent to \\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Thị xã Bình Minh\\\\\\\":\\\\n\\\\n*   **Clause 107:** This states that a part of \\\\\\\"phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\" is merged with \\\\\\\"phường Thành Phước\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Thuận An\\\\\\\" to form a new ward called \\\\\\\"**phường Bình Minh**.\\\\\\\"  So we have one potential new ward.  `citation`: \\\\\\\"107. Sắp xếp toàn bộ xã Thuận An và một phần diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số phường Thành Phước, phường Cái Vồn thành phường mới có tên gọi là**phường Bình Minh**.\\\\\\\"\\\\n*   **Clause 108:** This indicates that the *remaining part* of \\\\\\\"phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\" after the previous re-organisation will become **phường Cái Vồn** again (the new one).  `citation`: \\\\\\\"108. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số xã Mỹ Hòa (thị xã Bình Minh), phần còn lại của xã Ngãi Tứ sau khi sắp xếp theo quy định tại khoản 22 Điều này và phần còn lại của phường Thành Phước, phường Cái Vồn sau khi sắp xếp theo quy định tại khoản 107 Điều này thành phường mới có tên gọi là **phường Cái Vồn**.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis is where it gets interesting. Clause 107 implies a part of the original \\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\" morphs into \\\\\\\"Phường Bình Minh\\\\\\\". Clause 108 then clarifies that the *remainder* forms the new \\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, based on the resolution's wording, the old \\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\" could now be either \\\\\\\"Phường Bình Minh\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\" in the updated system.\\\\n\\\\nI then cross-referenced these potential new wards against the \\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\" list. Both \\\\\\\"Phường Bình Minh\\\\\\\" (with the code 29771) and \\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\" (with the code 29770) are present in the list and belong to the correct province, \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nGiven the original \\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\" is split, I can't definitively determine *which* new ward the input address precisely maps to without more specific location data (e.g., a specific street or area). Consequently, my confidence in a definitive answer is \\\\\\\"low.\\\\\\\" I'll need to flag this ambiguity.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1687/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"107.

The first step, as always, is to check for any province-level changes.

One part becomes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Bình Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and the rest is part of a newly created \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is a bit tricky since the original ward is divided into two new wards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChecking the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list confirms both possibilities: there's a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Bình Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (code 29771) and a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (code 29770), both in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the information available, and the fact that the original ward is now divided, I can't pinpoint the *exact* new ward solely from the address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Cái Vồn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I'd need more specific location details.
