  "thought": "**Initial Assessment and Problem Breakdown:**\n\nOkay, let's unpack this request. I've got to map an old Vietnamese administrative unit, specifically *Xã Lục Sỹ Thành* in *Huyện Trà Ôn, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long*, to its new equivalent. The user provided resolutions are the key here. The challenge? Districts get eliminated, provinces merge, and communes/wards get renamed or restructured. My output needs to be a valid JSON array adhering to a predefined schema, citing any relevant resolutions and indicating confidence levels.\n\n**Province-Level Analysis:**\n\nFirst things first, I checked for province mergers. Resolution `60-NQ/TW` indicates a merger involving Vĩnh Long, but thankfully, the name *Vĩnh Long* is retained. So, the province remains *Tỉnh Vĩnh Long* – that much is straightforward.\n\n**Commune-Level Deep Dive:**\n\nNow, for the crux of the matter: *Xã Lục Sỹ Thành*. I zeroed in on resolution `1687/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which pertains to commune-level adjustments in Vĩnh Long. Line by line, I scrutinized the text for any mention of my target commune. No luck! It's simply not mentioned. The resolution describes how *Tích Thiện*, *Trà Ôn*, *Loan Mỹ*, *Bình Ninh*, and *Ngãi Tứ* were restructured, but no dice for *Lục Sỹ Thành*.\n\n**Synthesizing the Information & Facing Uncertainty:**\n\nI've established that the old district *Huyện Trà Ôn* is no more, and the new province remains *Tỉnh Vĩnh Long*. However, the provided resolutions offer no direct mapping for *Xã Lục Sỹ Thành*. I've identified two new wards, *Xã Trà Ôn* and *Xã Ngãi Tứ*, formed from other communes within the old *Huyện Trà Ôn*, but the text *doesn't* explicitly state that *Lục Sỹ Thành* was absorbed into either. There's a slight possibility, a very speculative one, that it *could* have been merged into them given their shared history, but that's pure conjecture. The core issue is that I lack concrete evidence within the scope of the provided information. I must be precise with my conclusion. The user's prompt is very clear that if information is insufficient, an indication of *low confidence* is required.\n\n**Formulating the JSON Output & Final Decision:**\n\nGiven the lack of a direct mapping or a definitive link, I'm leaning toward an empty JSON array `[]`. The request states to return *all possible* candidates, but more importantly, to only work with the information provided. There is *no* evidence of a new ward for my given criteria. A return of an empty array is the most accurate representation of \"no result\", it follows the prompt accurately. This is the only path in this scenario.\n",

My objective is to pinpoint the new administrative unit(s) for the old ward \\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành, Huyện Trà Ôn, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\" The information provided includes a province resolution (60-NQ/TW) and a more specific one (1687/NQ-UBTVQH15) about the reorganization of administrative units in Vĩnh Long.\\n\\nFirst, I looked at province 60-NQ/TW. This highlighted that Vĩnh Long was part of a larger merger with Bến Tre and Trà Vinh, but the resulting province also remains \\\"Vĩnh Long\\\". So that doesn't directly help.\\n\\nMoving on to the detailed resolution 1687, I zeroed in. It's clearly about Vĩnh Long's administrative restructuring, which is a good sign. The text talks about wards within Huyện Trà Ôn, which is encouraging. I then examined the lines for a direct mention of \\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành.\\\" Unfortunately, it's *not* present.\\n\\nReading further, I found that the resolution details the formation of \\\"xã Trà Ôn\\\" and \\\"xã Ngãi Tứ\\\". This reorganization involves other wards *within* Huyện Trà Ôn.\\n\\nHowever, the key issue is that \\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in this document. Since the entire district is being rearranged, the absence of this ward suggests that the provided information is incomplete. It's likely that \\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\" was merged into one of the newly formed wards or a different ward not detailed in this specific snippet. So I can only conclude that with the information on hand, this mapping is not possible. I need more information to definitively pinpoint the new administrative unit for \\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành.\\\" The current data is insufficient.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành, Huyện Trà Ôn, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 15513,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0027996,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Navigating Vietnamese Administrative Restructuring**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with a tricky mapping problem: I need to pinpoint the current administrative location for the old ward \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\" within the now potentially restructured landscape of Vĩnh Long province.  My initial input is straightforward: \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\"Huyện Trà Ôn\\\\\\\" in the old \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nMy approach is systematic. First, I establish the context with resolution 60-NQ/TW. It flags a province merger, but Vĩnh Long's name actually *remains*. The province absorbed Bến Tre and Trà Vinh, making it larger but not changing the base name. This provides context, but doesn't directly solve the ward's re-location.\\\\n\\\\nThen I shift focus to resolution 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15, the most promising lead: it specifically deals with the rearrangement of communes in Vĩnh Long.  I pore over the text, looking for any mention of my target ward, \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành,\\\\\\\" or its parent district, \\\\\\\"Huyện Trà Ôn\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nUnfortunately, the text doesn't explicitly mention my ward. It focuses on the reorganization of other wards *within* the district, specifically creating two new communes: \\\\\\\"Xã Trà Ôn\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\" using some parts of \\\\\\\"thị trấn Trà Ôn\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"xã Tích Thiện\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"xã Loan Mỹ\\\\\\\", etc.\\\\n\\\\nMy analysis reveals a critical gap. The resolution is only *partially* complete; it describes *some* of the changes within the district.  It's clear that several wards were rearranged, which strongly suggests that the old wards were reconfigured into the new ones, or other wards not described.\\\\n\\\\nSince I don't have complete information, I'm left with a crucial inference:  the provided text doesn't have the full picture. My target ward \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\" is *not* accounted for. Based on this limited data, I can't definitively map it to any of the new communes. The provided information is insufficient to provide a complete and accurate answer. I can only surmise that \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\" likely now falls under the new administrative structure, but further research is necessary to pinpoint its precise location.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành, Huyện Trà Ôn, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 13694,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0027296,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Processing a Vietnamese Address Mapping Request**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I've got a tricky one here. I need to figure out the current administrative unit for an old Vietnamese address: `Xã Lục Sỹ Thành, Huyện Trà Ôn, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long`. I'm starting with the obvious: analyzing the components. Ward: `Xã Lục Sỹ Thành`, District: `Huyện Trà Ôn`, Province: `Tỉnh Vĩnh Long`. Simple enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to check the province resolutions to see if the province name has changed. I'm focusing on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  It's pretty clear that `Tỉnh Vĩnh Long` remains `Tỉnh Vĩnh Long`, even after considering mergers. Good, that simplifies things a bit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm digging into resolution 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically for `tỉnh Vĩnh Long`. This should hold the key.  I'm looking for mentions of `Xã Lục Sỹ Thành` or `Huyện Trà Ôn`. Aha! It discusses the creation of `Xã Trà Ôn` and `Xã Ngãi Tứ`, both involving parts of `Huyện Trà Ôn` and `thị trấn Trà Ôn`.  Crucially, though, my input ward, `Xã Lục Sỹ Thành`, isn't specifically mentioned. This means I can't pinpoint an exact match.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI'm now looking at the `New wards` list to see what information I can draw. It seems the resolutions create two new wards:  `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"29767\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}` and `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"29821\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem: I don't know *exactly* which new ward, if any, `Xã Lục Sỹ Thành` belongs to now.  It could be part of `Xã Trà Ôn`, `Xã Ngãi Tứ`, or something else entirely.  The information I have isn't complete. I'm missing some crucial data to make a definitive connection.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành, Huyện Trà Ôn, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 9127,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0033970999999999997,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating Vietnamese Administrative Restructuring**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to figure out the new administrative location for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on these resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the original address components: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the old ward) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the old province). Easy enough.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I checked Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW).  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" underwent some changes – it was initially merged with Bến Tre and Trà Vinh, but ultimately, the name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remained. So, the province itself seems stable.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, for the tricky part – the ward level. I dove into the relevant resolutions (1687/NQ-UBTVQH15) looking for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or its district, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Trà Ôn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I found mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tích Thiện,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Trà Ôn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Loan Mỹ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bình Ninh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ngãi Tứ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but *no* explicit reference to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  That's my main hurdle.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, I saw that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *is* mentioned, which is part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Trà Ôn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Resolutions detailed the formation of two new wards: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (created from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tích Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (created from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Loan Mỹ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bình Ninh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" parts of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the *remaining* part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe absence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in these merging details is the key. It could mean \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was absorbed into one of the new wards, was renamed, was merged into a ward not explicitly detailed here, or it was even kept unchanged (though the prompt suggests most wards were altered).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConsidering this, and the prompt's instructions to find *all* possible new wards, I'd say \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are *potential* candidates.  They were created within the same district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and so there is a *possibility* it was merged into one of these new wards, or the other unmentioned new wards in Trà Ôn district.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, given the lack of direct linkage in the resolutions, I have to qualify this. The confidence level is low because I can't confirm this mapping. I must provide these two candidate wards with this low confidence:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"29767\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"29821\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"20.

I need to verify its status in light of the province resolutions (60-NQ/TW).  Fortunately, while there's a merger involving Vĩnh Long, Bến Tre, and Trà Vinh, the final province name remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" So, the province name is good.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe tricky part is mapping the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I've been given a set of resolutions (1687/NQ-UBTVQH15) related to ward changes in the area.  Here's where things get interesting:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in these resolutions.  However, the address includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Trà Ôn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" so I'm focusing on those parts.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe resolutions detail the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from other wards/towns within Trà Ôn district.  Specifically, parts of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and other communes are used to form these new wards.  Crucially, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't listed as a direct component of either. This implies a few possibilities: it might have been fully merged into one of these new wards, renamed, merged into a ward that's not fully detailed here, or (less likely, but possible) remained unchanged.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSince my task is to identify *possible* new wards, it's very likely it's a part of either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

However, I have to be clear about the uncertainty. The confidence level is pretty low here since the merge details don't explicitly include \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Sỹ Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The provided candidate new wards are: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngãi Tứ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Ôn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which makes them the most likely candidates.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"20.
