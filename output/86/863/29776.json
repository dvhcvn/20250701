My goal is to determine the new administrative unit for the old \"Xã Tân Thành, Huyện Bình Tân, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\" First, I need to confirm the province name. Checking the resolutions related to administrative changes (specifically 60-NQ/TW), it's clear that while some provinces might have merged, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long remains unchanged.\n\nNow, I'm diving into the resolutions from the National Assembly Standing Committee (15th term) to see if there have been any changes at the ward level. My strategy is to systematically scan each resolution, focusing on the context of \"Tân Thành\" within the Vĩnh Long province. This means meticulously checking each mention of \"Tân Thành\" against the established province and district information. I've gone through a considerable number of resolutions (1654/NQ-UBTVQH15 through 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15), looking for that critical match.  While many resolutions mention \"Tân Thành,\" none have directly correlated to the specific location I'm searching for: Xã Tân Thành, Huyện Bình Tân, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long. I'm hitting a wall here. It seems no modifications have been made to this ward.\n",

My task is to figure out the new administrative structure for \\\"Xã Tân Thành, Huyện Bình Tân, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\". First, I dissected the address: \\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\" is the ward, \\\"Huyện Bình Tân\\\" is the district, and \\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\" is the province. Simple enough.\\n\\nNext, I quickly remembered the province's reorganization from Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Ah yes, the merger of Bến Tre, Vĩnh Long, and Trà Vinh, with Vĩnh Long keeping its name. Good, the province part of the address checks out.\\n\\nNow, time to dive into the specific resolutions concerning ward-level changes within Vĩnh Long. I homed in on Resolution 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key document for these rearrangements. I meticulously scanned it, looking for any mention of \\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\".\\n\\nI ran through the lines, starting with the first potentially relevant line. Line 25 mentioned \\\"huyện Bình Tân,\\\" but the ward cited was \\\"Tân Bình,\\\" not \\\"Tân Thành\\\". Then, *aha!* Line 26: \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các **xã Tân Thành**, Tân An Thạnh và Tân Lược thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tân Lược**.\\\" That's the one! It specifically references \\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\". However, I noticed immediately that the district wasn't specified. I needed to be sure there wasn't another \\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\" in Vĩnh Long. After thoroughly scanning the remainder of the document, I'm confident there wasn't another relevant \\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\".\\n\\nThe resolution states that Xã Tân Thành (along with two others) has been merged into a new unit, called Xã Tân Lược.

First, the province is \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long,\\\\\\\" and as per Resolution 60-NQ/TW, it hasn't been merged with any other province, so that's simple. Now, to the meat of it – checking for any relevant province resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nI found Resolution 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15, \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\\\\\" Perfect. Line 26 caught my eye: it mentions \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\\\\\" along with \\\\\\\"Tân An Thạnh\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Tân Lược,\\\\\\\" resulting in a new ward called \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Lược.\\\\\\\"  Crucially, it **doesn't** explicitly say \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành, Huyện Bình Tân.\\\\\\\" That's a little tricky. There could be multiple \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\\\\\" across different districts.\\\\n\\\\nI scanned the entire resolution, and line 25 explicitly names a ward and its district. Furthermore, line 68 names \\\\\\\"Tân Thành Bình\\\\\\\" as a new unit.  So it's clear the resolution *can* specify the district when necessary. The fact that the line 26 doesn't specify the district for \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\\\\\" is a bit of a wrinkle. This ambiguity gives me pause, but the user *did* provide \\\\\\\"Huyện Bình Tân\\\\\\\" in the old address.\\\\n\\\\nTo mitigate this, I'll cross-reference with known data, such as the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" list for \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\\\\\" I know a \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Lược\\\\\\\" exists, and it is located within the correct province.\\\\n\\\\nSo, while there's a slight element of uncertainty due to the resolution's phrasing, the existing data strongly suggests that the old \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành, Huyện Bình Tân\\\\\\\" is likely now part of the new \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Lược.\\\\\\\" This warrants a further investigation, but this is the best conclusion I can draw with the information available.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1687/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"26.

First, straightforward: the province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  No surprises there, despite past mergers.  Now, I'm digging into those province resolutions, specifically checking for the relevant one regarding Vĩnh Long's administrative restructuring.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI found Resolution 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15, a clear candidate.  I started scanning for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Bingo! Line 26: it's part of a consolidation.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành, Tân An Thạnh, and Tân Lược\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are merging to create \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Lược\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, the initial address includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bình Tân,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and this line in the resolution doesn't specify a district for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tân Thành.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It could be any \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI kept digging through the rest of the resolution. I found a line that *does* specify a district, making me more suspicious that the absence of a district qualifier here is important. Line 25 explicitly mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Bình (huyện Bình Tân)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis makes me re-evaluate line 26.  Is the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in question *this* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Thành, Huyện Bình Tân\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"? The resolution leaves it ambiguous.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be sure, I cross-referenced this against the list of New Wards. I found `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"29785\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Lược\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`.  The existence of this, and the merger in the resolution, points towards \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Lược\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the correct answer.  It's just that the original address's exact district information isn't perfectly clear in the resolution.  However, this is the most likely case.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1687/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"26.
