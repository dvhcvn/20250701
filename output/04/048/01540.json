  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \"Xã Thắng Lợi, Huyện Hạ Lang, Tỉnh Cao Bằng\" and need to determine its current administrative location. My expert assessment begins by breaking down the problem into manageable steps:\n\nFirst, I quickly identify \"Tỉnh Cao Bằng\" as the province. A quick check of Resolution 60-NQ/TW confirms that Cao Bằng didn't undergo any province-level mergers, so \"Tỉnh Cao Bằng\" stays.\n\nNext, I focused on the ward, \"Xã Thắng Lợi.\" Since the prompt mentions \"eliminating all districts,\" and the output schema only includes province, ward, and code, the old district of \"Huyện Hạ Lang\" doesn't directly factor into my primary analysis, though I'll keep it in mind. My primary focus is the ward and province.\n\nNow comes the crucial step: I need to consult the relevant resolutions. I immediately turned to the \"Other resolutions\" and searched for \"Thắng Lợi\" within \"Cao Bằng.\" Bingo! Resolution 1657/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically line 53, is the key: it explicitly states that \"Xã Thắng Lợi\" is merged, along with \"Đức Quang\" and \"Quang Long,\" into a new ward called \"Xã Quang Long.\" This is a high-confidence finding because the prompt is for a *ward change*.\n\nTo be absolutely sure, I confirmed this within my internal knowledge of this data. I made sure to check the relevant entries in the `new_wards` data, I was able to find that `ward_name: \"Xã Quang Long\"` and `province_name: \"Tỉnh Cao Bằng\"` correspond perfectly.\n\nFinally, the JSON output is constructed to give me:\n\n*   `province_name`: \"Tỉnh Cao Bằng\" (remains unchanged)\n*   `ward_code`: \"01552\" (from `new_wards`)\n*   `ward_name`: \"Xã Quang Long\" (from the resolution)\n*   `citation`: The relevant resolution and line where the information is.\n*   `confidence`: \"high\" (because of the clear merging).\n\nTo ensure no issues, I made sure there were no conflicting name matches in other provinces by checking other places with names like \"Thắng Lợi\" to confirm no ambiguity. This confirms my analysis is accurate and I'm very confident in my output.\n",
