  "thought": "**Analysis of \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I've got to determine the current status of \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" based on these resolutions concerning Vietnamese provincial-level administrative changes. My expertise in this area is key, so I'll approach this methodically.\n\nFirst, I've got to analyze the provided information. I know the old unit is \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" and I have these two resolutions: one about provinces *not* being merged, and another about the *new* provinces formed after mergers.\n\nI'll start by thoroughly scanning the first resolution – the one about units *not* merging. I'm carefully reading through that list, checking each line. Ah, there it is! \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" is listed. Great. This tells me, definitively, that \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" is *not* being merged according to this resolution.\n\nNow, just to be absolutely sure, I'll quickly check the second resolution. I'll scan through it, looking for any mention of \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" as part of a merger. Nope, nothing. Confirmed! My initial finding is solid.\n\nThe next step is straightforward. Since \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" isn't being merged, it remains the same. Easy. But I also need to find the correct province code. I'll search through the unit list and, yes, I've found it: `\"40\"` is the code for \"Nghệ An.\"\n\nMy confidence in this result is very high. The information is clear and directly stated in the resolution. The citation is straightforward and it's from resolution `60-NQ/TW`.\n\nI have to format the output as JSON. I know the required structure: an array with an object inside. The object contains the province name (\"Nghệ An\"), the province code (\"40\"), the confidence level (\"high\"), and a proper citation from the resolution. And there it is: I am now ready to generate the JSON.\n",
