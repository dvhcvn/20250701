  "thought": "**Mapping Vietnamese Administrative Units: Tỉnh Lạng Sơn**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. As an expert in Vietnamese administrative unit mapping, my goal is clear: determine the new unit for \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\" given the provided resolutions.\n\nFirst, I meticulously analyzed the input. I know I'm dealing with \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\" and have resolutions to guide me: `60-NQ/TW` outlining non-merged provinces and merged ones. I also have a list of province IDs and names, and I understand the required JSON output format.\n\nMy strategy? Scan these resolutions like a hawk, specifically for \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn.\" In the first resolution, which details non-merged provinces, there it is! \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\" is listed. Since this resolution explicitly states non-merger, I can confidently assume it remains \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn.\" I did a quick double-check in the second resolution to confirm no mention of Lạng Sơn in any merging scenario. That check further solidifies my conclusion.\n\nNext, I need to pinpoint the province code. I cross-reference \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\" with the provided list of province IDs and names. I quickly found a match: \"Lạng Sơn\" with the ID \"20.\" Therefore, the relevant province code is 20.\n\nNow, to assemble the JSON output. I'll make a single-element array, crafting a well-structured JSON element according to the specified schema. The province name is \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn,\" the province code is \"20,\" and I set the confidence to \"high\" because the resolution provides explicit evidence. For the citation, I'll extract the relevant header and line from the resolution, ensuring clear traceability.\n\nBefore I commit to the output, I'm verifying the result: Valid JSON array? Check. Fields correctly populated? Check. Schema followed? Absolutely. Are there any extraneous elements? Nope. Control characters? None. Double quotes for all strings? Yes. Everything looks good. Time to deliver that JSON.\n",
