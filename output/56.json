  "thought": "**Analysis and Resolution for \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa\"**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My goal is to pinpoint the new administrative unit corresponding to the old \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa.\"  I'll be using the provided resolutions to guide me.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what I'm looking for. It's a straight-forward request: find the new unit, formatted as a JSON array with specific fields. Confidence levels are important, so I'll keep an eye on how certain I am about each step.  I have to ensure the citation includes both a header and a line from the resolution.\n\nInitial thought is to scan the resolutions for the text \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa.\" I decided to look at Resolution 1 first to eliminate any possibilities that were excluded from the merger.  This list had several provinces, but \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa\" wasn't among them, so I reasoned it was merged or renamed, and should be in the second resolution.\n\nThen, I focused on Resolution 2, \"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất.\" I went line by line. I had to pay close attention. I finally found line 13: \"Hợp nhất tỉnh Ninh Thuận và tỉnh Khánh Hoà, lấy tên là tỉnh Khánh Hoà.\" Bingo!  That directly addresses the initial query. The old \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa\" is involved in a merger, and the result is... \"tỉnh Khánh Hoà\".\n\nNow, I'm confident. The resolution is very clear. It's time to build the JSON. I know the new name is \"tỉnh Khánh Hoà\" (from the resolution). However, I have a standard ID list to use to find the name I should use to populate the `province_name` in the JSON.  The ID list shows a province ID \"56\" associated with the province name \"Khánh Hòa\".  While the resolution uses \"tỉnh Khánh Hoà\", the ID list is the most standard, and I'll use \"Khánh Hòa\".\n\nSo, the JSON object will have `province_code` as \"56\", `province_name` as \"Khánh Hòa\", `confidence` as \"high\", and the `citation` details (the resolution header and the line).\n\nFinally, I need to make sure the JSON structure is correct. Since there's only one resulting unit, the array will contain a single JSON object. The formatting is also correct. I think I'm good to go!\n",
