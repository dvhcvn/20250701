  "thought": "**Analyzing the Address and Resolutions**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \"Xã Yên Sơn, Huyện Yên Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La\" and tasked with finding its corresponding new administrative unit. My initial thought process is to dive into the relevant resolutions and ward lists to pinpoint the updated ward.\n\nFirst, I quickly ruled out any province-level changes, as the merger resolution 60-NQ/TW explicitly states that Sơn La remains unchanged. The real work begins by checking other resolutions specific to Sơn La, particularly those concerning ward-level reorganizations.\n\nI focused on resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with exactly this scenario: \"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Sơn La\". My examination of the relevant lines quickly led me to line 41. It clearly states that the old \"Xã Yên Sơn\" is being *merged with* \"Xã Chiềng On\" to create a *new* \"Xã Yên Sơn\". That's a key piece of information! It means the ward's *name* is retained, but its physical boundaries and population have changed.\n\nNow, I needed to locate this new \"Xã Yên Sơn\" within the \"New wards\" list, specifically in the Sơn La section. A quick search yielded a single result: `{\"ward_code\":\"04087\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Yên Sơn\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Sơn La\"}`.\n\nThis looks like a solid match. The province name is spot-on, and the ward name matches exactly what the resolution stated. The resolution also states that the old \"Xã Yên Sơn\" is part of the new ward, leaving me with high confidence.\n\nThe mention of \"Huyện Yên Châu\" does not appear, as the general rule in Vietnam is to eliminate all districts in the new administrative structure.\n\nTherefore, my final conclusion is that the new administrative unit for the old address \"Xã Yên Sơn, Huyện Yên Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La\" is \"Xã Yên Sơn\" with the code \"04087\" in \"Tỉnh Sơn La\". This conclusion rests on the explicit language in resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15 and the corresponding entry in the \"New wards\" list. The ward name is confirmed by the resolution, and it matches the list. The province remains the same.\n",
