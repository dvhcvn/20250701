  "thought": "**My Analysis of \"Xã Pú Pẩu\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with identifying the new administrative unit for \"Xã Pú Pẩu, Huyện Sông Mã, Tỉnh Sơn La\".  First things first, I need to break down the information I have: the old ward (\"Xã Pú Pẩu\"), its district (\"Huyện Sông Mã\"), and the province (\"Tỉnh Sơn La\").\n\nKnowing my usual steps, I'll start by checking if the province has been affected by any mergers. According to Resolution 60-NQ/TW, \"Tỉnh Sơn La\" is *not* listed as a province that has undergone any merger. So, at least the province remains the same.\n\nNext, I need to look at specific resolutions that could shed light on the ward's current status within the province. Resolution `1681/NQ-UBTVQH15` comes up. It's related to administrative rearrangements in Sơn La. When I examine the resolution, I see that it details the merger of \"thị trấn Sông Mã\" and \"xã Nà Nghịu\" into a new ward called \"Xã Sông Mã\". However, crucially, \"Xã Pú Pẩu\" isn't mentioned anywhere in this resolution.\n\nNow I move on to checking the provided list of potential new wards. The ones I have are: \"Xã Hiệp Cường\" (wrong province), \"Xã Sông Mã\" (correct province, but a new ward created from merging other units, and not the ward I am looking for), and \"Phường Đa Mai\" (also the wrong province).\n\nGiven the information I've analyzed, the province remains the same, but the ward in question isn't mentioned. It doesn't look like \"Xã Pú Pẩu\" is included in the merger described in resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15. I cannot link \"Xã Pú Pẩu\" to any of the provided candidates.\n\nGiven the problem statement, specifically, \"eliminating all districts,\" and lacking any other context, the most accurate answer is that I cannot determine the new administrative unit for \"Xã Pú Pẩu\" with the information available. Returning an empty array, as instructed, is the correct action in this scenario.\n",

I need to analyze the provided resolutions and come up with a JSON array that maps the old to the new, with confidence levels and citations. Let's break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I identified the components of the old address: Ward (Xã) - Pú Pẩu, District (Huyện) - Sông Mã, and Province (Tỉnh) - Sơn La. I then started by checking province-level resolutions to see if Sơn La was merged with any other province, and it wasn't. The 60-NQ/TW resolution clearly states that Sơn La is *not* being merged. So, the new province is still Sơn La. That's straightforward.\\n\\nNext, I dove into the ward/commune-level resolutions the user provided. I went through each one, skipping those that weren't related to Sơn La. I paid close attention to Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, which is specific to Sơn La. Line 56 mentions a merging of \\\"thị trấn Sông Mã\\\" and \\\"xã Nà Nghịu\\\" into a new \\\"xã Sông Mã\\\". This is interesting because it deals with a reorganization within the same district (Sông Mã), which is what I'm dealing with. However, the resolution *doesn't* explicitly mention \\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\". The user's prompt emphasizes that *all districts are eliminated*. This is a crucial piece of information. This means that all communes (xã) within a former district are likely re-organized.\\n\\nConsidering I don't see any explicit mapping for \\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\" in these resolutions, and the prompt states that all districts are eliminated, I need to adjust my approach. I'm going to leverage the fact that \\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\" *must* have been reorganized, since it was within a now-eliminated district. The information provided by the user about potential \\\"New wards\\\" provides a strong clue. I need to cross-reference this information.\\n\\nI'll output the most probable ward and include an appropriate confidence level, indicating that while no direct citation exists, the context makes the mapping very likely. My JSON will include my rationale in the citation field.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Sơn La\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Pú Pẩu, Huyện Sông Mã, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 14820,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0027053,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Insufficient Data to Determine New Ward**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so the user wants me to map \\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu, Huyện Sông Mã, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\" to its new administrative unit, post-restructuring.  I've got a list of resolutions and new ward information to work with.  My initial thought is to break this down into a province, district, and ward analysis.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I looked at the province.  The old ward is in Sơn La province. Checking the resolutions, particularly `60-NQ/TW`, I see Sơn La is explicitly listed as a province *not* undergoing merger. So, the province itself remains unchanged. Good.\\\\n\\\\nNext, the district. The user has explicitly stated that districts have been eliminated in this restructuring.  \\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Mã\\\\\\\" no longer exists as an administrative level. That's a key piece of information.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the ward: \\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\".  I've scanned the resolutions for any mention of this specific ward.  I quickly ruled out Bắc Ninh and Hưng Yên resolutions as irrelevant.  The Sơn La resolution, `1681/NQ-UBTVQH15`, seemed promising, but it only mentions the merger of \\\\\\\"thị trấn Sông Mã\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Nà Nghịu\\\\\\\" into the new \\\\\\\"xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\" is *not* mentioned.\\\\n\\\\nSynthesizing this, I know the province is unchanged, the district is gone, but the specific ward, \\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\", isn't covered by the provided resolutions.  The resolutions supplied are a very limited sample of the changes.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, given the information I have, I *cannot* determine the new ward for \\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\". The data is simply insufficient.  My best course of action is to return an empty array or a result indicating low confidence, perhaps with null values for the new ward and relevant codes. This reflects my inability to provide a definitive answer based on the user's input and the provided resources.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu, Huyện Sông Mã, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 14223,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0027978,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user needs help finding the new address for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu, Huyện Sông Mã, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I'm looking at this in a structured way.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I parsed the input address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the province.  Easy enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI immediately checked for province-level changes. The initial check of Resolution 60-NQ/TW shows that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged, which aligns with the information I have regarding new wards. So, Sơn La itself is good.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key now is to figure out what happened at the ward and district level, given the user's information. I know all districts are being eliminated and that most wards have been renamed, split, or merged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI reviewed the provided resolutions. I know Resolutions 1658 and 1666 are for Bắc Ninh and Hưng Yên respectively, so I can immediately rule them out. I then moved to Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, specific to Sơn La. This seems more promising. I found a line that mentions a new ward named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" created by merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nà Nghịu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". That's relevant because both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nà Nghịu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" were in the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, crucially, it *doesn't* mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specifically.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I looked at the provided list of new wards. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hiệp Cường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Đa Mai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are irrelevant as they are not in Sơn La. The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" entry is the main candidate. It does mention Sơn La, it's a new ward, and it's from the same old district. But, as I mentioned, the resolution doesn't definitively say \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was absorbed into this new ward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe problem is that I'm working with incomplete data. The prompt mentions restructuring across all administrative units. The resolutions I have are just samples, so it's likely they don't cover everything.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" could have merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but the specific details might not be present in this snippet. Alternatively, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" might have become part of a new ward not listed here, or it may have kept its name.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn short, I can't be *certain* of the new ward for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on the provided information, but I *suspect* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the closest candidate. However, I need more comprehensive data to confirm it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu, Huyện Sông Mã, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8178,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0030628000000000005,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu, Huyện Sông Mã, Tỉnh Sơn La,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to figure out its new administrative unit.  Here's how I'm approaching this:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I break down the input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (province).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI start with the province.  I quickly see from the 60-NQ/TW resolution that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged. Good, that's straightforward. So, the `province_name` in my output is definitely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I move on to the more complex part: the ward and district. I check the other resolutions. 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 and 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15 are irrelevant; the provinces don't match.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen I get to 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, the Sơn La resolution. It *is* relevant, but here's where things get tricky.  It describes the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nà Nghịu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". That's in the right district, but the key is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't mentioned *at all* in this resolution.  It only focuses on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nà Nghịu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then go through the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.  I see a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" listed, which seems promising. But, again, it was created from the two aforementioned wards.  The other two entries don't apply, as they are not in the province in question.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy conclusion is this:  While I have information about changes in Sơn La, and specifically the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", none of the data I have relates directly to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The provided resolutions only detail specific ward mergers and name changes, and my input ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", isn't one of them.  The prompt mentions that wards have been renamed, split or merged, but it also says some wards may remain unchanged. It also stresses to indicate if the information is insufficient. I'm therefore unable to conclusively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a specific new ward based *solely* on the data I have. I have a low confidence in making any direct association between the old ward and a new ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"5.

The user has given me the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu, Huyện Sông Mã, Tỉnh Sơn La,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to figure out its new administrative unit, if any.  My initial assessment is to break down the problem and cross-reference available data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I parsed the input address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I looked at the province-level resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW). This one was straightforward; Sơn La is listed as a province that *didn't* undergo any mergers. So, at least the province remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, I went through the other resolutions. 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Bắc Ninh) and 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Hưng Yên) were irrelevant since they weren't about Sơn La. But, 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15 *is* relevant. It specifically addresses changes in Sơn La. I read through it carefully, and I found a key detail in line 56: they created a new ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nà Nghịu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is interesting, but \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wasn't mentioned *at all* in this resolution. It only addressed the merger of those other two.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I examined the provided New Wards data. I noticed the data for Hưng Yên and Bắc Ninh which are irrelevant. Then, I found one matching \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Sơn La. But, this doesn't help me much because the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is from the merger mentioned in the 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, here's the bottom line. The province remains the same. Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15 *does* create \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sông Mã,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Sông Mã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nà Nghịu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't addressed by any of the provided resolutions or in the new wards data. Therefore, I can't determine, with any confidence, what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Based on the instructions, since the data is insufficient, my confidence is low, and I cannot confidently map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Pú Pẩu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"5.
