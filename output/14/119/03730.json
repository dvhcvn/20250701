  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with transforming this old Vietnamese address into its corresponding new administrative unit. Let's break it down. First, I need to pinpoint the constituent parts of the original address: \"Xã Chiềng Pha\" (the old ward), \"Huyện Thuận Châu\" (old district), and \"Tỉnh Sơn La\" (the old province).\n\nNow, the instructions are clear that we're eliminating districts, so the district part is less relevant for the final output, it is for context, however. I'm going to start by checking the province resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW).  Fortunately, \"Tỉnh Sơn La\" is listed as a province *not* undergoing merger or change in that section. That means the province name, for now, remains \"Tỉnh Sơn La.\"\n\nNext, I'll dive into the other critical resolution, 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15.  The header confirms that this resolution concerns itself with the province in question, \"Tỉnh Sơn La\".  I'll need to meticulously scan the lines within the resolution, specifically focusing on \"Xã Chiềng Pha.\" Ah, here it is!  Line 18 is the key. It states that \"Xã Chiềng Pha\" is being combined with \"Xã Phổng Lái\" to create a new ward, \"Xã Bình Thuận.\"\n\nNow, let's cross-reference this newly found \"Xã Bình Thuận\" with the provided \"New Wards\" data.  There it is!  The data confirms that there's a match, with the `ward_code` being \"03724\" and the `province_name` matching what I have determined so far.\n\nFinally, I'll package all this information into a neatly organized JSON output.  It'll include the \"Tỉnh Sơn La\" as the province, \"Xã Bình Thuận\" as the new ward, and its corresponding code. The JSON will also include a citation from resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically line 18 as the source.\n\nBecause I have a direct and unambiguous match, I can confidently label this match with a \"high\" confidence level. The request mentions \"all possible new ward candidates,\" but in this particular instance, there's only one. This should be a straightforward and accurate mapping.\n",
