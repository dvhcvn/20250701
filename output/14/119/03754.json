  "thought": "**Mapping Old to New Administrative Unit: No Confident Mapping Found**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to map \"Xã Noong Lay, Huyện Thuận Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La\" to a new administrative unit based on the provided resolutions. I've got two primary resolutions to work with: `60-NQ/TW` and `1681/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  `60-NQ/TW` confirms that Sơn La province remains unchanged, which aligns with my understanding.\n\n`1681/NQ-UBTVQH15` is where things get interesting. It details the re-organization of communes within Sơn La province.  Specifically, it mentions the formation of \"Xã Thuận Châu\" from the merger of thị trấn Thuận Châu and several other communes *except* for \"Xã Noong Lay\".  I also have a database entry suggesting \"Xã Thuận Châu\" (with code 03721) exists, reinforcing the information from the resolution.\n\nNow, the instructions are clear. I need to identify *one or more* new wards that *may* contain the old ward. And if the information is insufficient, I need to indicate low confidence.  I went through the resolution meticulously, line by line, looking for any mention of \"Xã Noong Lay\".  It's simply not there. The resolution explicitly defines the components of \"Xã Thuận Châu\", and \"Xã Noong Lay\" isn't included.\n\nWhile I can see a geographical link - both \"Xã Noong Lay\" and the merged units that form \"Xã Thuận Châu\" are from Huyện Thuận Châu - that's not enough to justify a confident mapping. The prompt emphasizes the need for a mapping *based on provided information*.  The provided information doesn't give any clue that *Xã Noong Lay* ended up inside the new ward. Therefore, I can't definitively say \"Xã Thuận Châu\" contains or is related to \"Xã Noong Lay\" in a conclusive manner, even if there is an intuitive sense of proximity.\n\nThe instructions say to provide all possible candidates. Since I have no explicit evidence within the *provided text* to suggest where \"Xã Noong Lay\" now exists, I must be honest.  I've found *no* suitable candidate. I can't invent a mapping. An empty JSON array `[]` is the appropriate response, indicating that based on the limited data I have, a direct mapping is not possible.  I'm adhering strictly to the prompt's requirement to base my conclusion on the *provided* context.\n",

The user wants me to map an old administrative unit, Xã Noong Lay in Huyện Thuận Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La, to a new one, based on some resolutions about mergers and rearrangements. I need to output a JSON array according to a specified schema.\\n\\nFirst, I broke down the request. I know the old ward is Xã Noong Lay, in the district of Thuận Châu, in the province of Sơn La.  My initial thought was to check for any province-level changes first. The 60-NQ/TW resolution clarifies that Sơn La is *not* merged with any other province, so its boundaries remain intact. That's a relief!\\n\\nNext, I looked at the more granular resolution provided, 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, specific to Sơn La's wards and communes. This should be relevant. It mentioned a new \\\"xã Thuận Châu\\\" being formed by merging several other units in the Thuận Châu district. However, and this is the crux of the issue, Xã Noong Lay isn't explicitly listed as a component of the new \\\"xã Thuận Châu\\\". The resolution only listed the other units that make up the new ward.\\n\\nThe key here is that the problem statement said districts are being eliminated and most wards are being renamed or merged.  Because Noong Lay is in Thuận Châu district, and there's a resolution about Thuận Châu, I *suspect* Noong Lay was also affected by the rearrangement, even though it isn't specifically mentioned.  The provided resolution just doesn't say *what* happened to other wards in the district besides the ones merged into the new \\\"xã Thuận Châu\\\". I don't see any other info.\\n\\nTherefore, because Noong Lay's not mentioned, it's difficult to conclude with full certainty where it ended up. I'll need to research further.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Sơn La\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Noong Lay, Huyện Thuận Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 13132,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0024593,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, let's break this down. I've been given an address: \\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay, Huyện Thuận Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La,\\\\\\\" and I need to figure out its new administrative unit.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I parsed the address: \\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\"Huyện Thuận Châu\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\" is the province.  I know I need to consult Resolution 60-NQ/TW to see if the province has been affected by any mergers.  Good news, \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\" is listed as a province that *wasn't* merged, so that's unchanged.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I looked at a more specific resolution, `1681/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which deals with the *specific* changes within Sơn La province. This is crucial.  The resolution mentions a new ward named \\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\" being formed from merging several other units in \\\\\\\"Huyện Thuận Châu\\\\\\\".  However, and this is the problem, \\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\" *isn't* mentioned in that list of merged units.\\\\n\\\\nThe key is that the user states \\\\\\\"districts are eliminated\\\\\\\". The creation of \\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\" is the *only* change explicitly detailed in the text provided.  I know that \\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\" *was* part of the old \\\\\\\"Huyện Thuận Châu,\\\\\\\" and that \\\\\\\"Huyện Thuận Châu\\\\\\\" is being eliminated. The implication is that \\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\" *must* now belong to some new administrative structure.\\\\n\\\\nThe user states that I should Find one or multiple new wards, however, I am only given data of one new ward: \\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu.\\\\\\\" Given this, the only possible candidate is \\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\".  However, because the source text doesn't specify if \\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\" merged with \\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\", I can't be sure this is the case. I need more information to confirm this or identify any other possibilities.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay, Huyện Thuận Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 8570,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0029143,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Analysis of Administrative Unit Mapping: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay, Huyện Thuận Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I've been tasked with mapping this old address, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay, Huyện Thuận Châu, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", to a new administrative unit based on these resolutions and ward data. Let's break this down.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I checked the province resolutions regarding administrative restructuring.  It seems Sơn La province itself is staying put - no province-level mergers are happening, which is good to know. Then I dug into other resolutions related to Thuận Châu district. I found resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, which outlines some specific mergers *within* Thuận Châu. It details a merger of Thị trấn Thuận Châu, Phổng Ly, Thôm Mòn, Tông Lạnh, and Chiềng Pấc to form a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Crucially, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't listed among these.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, looking at the provided new ward data, we have `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"03721\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`. This \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the result of that merger from resolution 1681.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in this resolution that creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The prompt *does* say that most wards have been renamed, split, or merged. Given that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't on the list that makes up the *new* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", it *could* have been merged into something else entirely, renamed, or even (less likely, but possible) left unchanged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI have to be careful here. I can't definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with the information provided. There's simply no direct link in these resolutions.  Given what I *do* have, all I can say is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" likely *isn't* part of the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" formed by the listed communes. However, it's possible that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged into a *different* new ward or renamed, but I can't provide that definitive mapping from what I have here. Therefore, I'm going to have to report that the confidence is low, and I cannot provide a specific ward code or name based *solely* on the data given. I'll flag that I need more information to map this accurately.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1681/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"12.

My task is to figure out the corresponding new administrative unit. My initial thought is to break this down by analyzing the province and district specifically looking for any relevant resolutions or changes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I confirmed that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW. That's a good starting point.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, I focused on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15 details a re-organization of *some* of the wards in the district, creating a new ward called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" through the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and several other communes. Crucially, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly listed as one of the merged entities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI'm given the new ward data: `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"03721\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`.  While this \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" exists, it's a *new* entity formed from *other* wards. My analysis shows \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't directly mentioned in this merger.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy expert judgment is that, given *only* the information provided, I can't definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with high confidence. The provided data does not show that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Noong Lay\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged with any other wards. This is a crucial detail. The prompt specifically instructs me to consider all possible candidates, but based *solely* on the provided documentation, I can't generate a confident mapping. Therefore, my confidence level for a mapping to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is low. As I lack data for the mapping, I cannot provide a specific `ward_code` or `ward_name`. While the instruction states \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Make sure to include all possible new ward candidates,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the given data does not include any candidate for the mapping.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1681/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"12.
