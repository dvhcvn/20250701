  "thought": "**Determining the New Ward for the Given Address**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with pinpointing the new administrative unit (ward) for the old address \"Xã Chiềng Sung, Huyện Mai Sơn, Tỉnh Sơn La\".  My initial approach is to rigorously check the relevant resolutions and compare them against the list of available new wards.  This should be straightforward, given the structure of Vietnamese administrative changes.\n\nFirst, I quickly reviewed Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW) to confirm that \"Tỉnh Sơn La\" remains unchanged, which it does.  No province-level mergers are happening here.\n\nNext, I skimmed through the other resolutions (1673, 1678) but immediately dismissed them because they pertain to provinces other than Sơn La (Lào Cai and Nghệ An, respectively). They are irrelevant to the current task.\n\nThe crucial document is 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, the resolution concerning Sơn La.  I began carefully examining its provisions, starting with point 43, which details the formation of a new \"Xã Mai Sơn\". However, this involved wards other than the target \"Xã Chiềng Sung\", so I moved on. Point 47 detailed the merger of \"Xã Chiềng Chung\" and \"Xã Mường Chanh\", which, again, was not the target.\n\nThen, I hit paydirt with point 49. It explicitly states that \"Xã Chiềng Sung\" (the old one) is merged with \"Xã Chiềng Chăn\" to form a *new* \"Xã Chiềng Sung\".  Bingo! That directly addresses the old ward I was given.\n\nWith the resolution identified, I moved to the list of new wards.  After eliminating the non-Sơn La options, the crucial entry `{\"ward_code\":\"04108\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Chiềng Sung\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Sơn La\"}` jumped out. This *perfectly* matches the new ward as identified by the resolution. It confirms that \"Xã Chiềng Sung\" is the result of the merger I'd just found.\n\nSo, the conclusion is clear. The old address \"Xã Chiềng Sung, Huyện Mai Sơn, Tỉnh Sơn La\" now corresponds to the new ward \"Xã Chiềng Sung, Tỉnh Sơn La\" with the ward code 04108. The confidence is high because the resolution directly addresses the specific ward in question and the matching ward in the list of new ones.  It's a textbook application of interpreting these administrative directives.\n",
