  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Address Change**\n\nOkay, let me break this down. The user's request is pretty clear: they want to find the updated administrative unit for the old address \"Xã Nà Pó, Huyện Mai Sơn, Tỉnh Sơn La\". I'm starting with the obvious:\n\n1.  **Breaking Down the Old Address:** I've identified the ward (\"Xã Nà Pó\"), district (\"Huyện Mai Sơn\"), and province (\"Tỉnh Sơn La\"). Now, I need to see what's changed.\n\n2.  **Province Stability:** I've checked the \"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\" list (60-NQ/TW), and it confirms that \"Tỉnh Sơn La\" remains unchanged. Good.\n\n3.  **District and Ward Scrutiny:** The user provided some resolutions, and that's where things get interesting. I've gone through each one:\n\n    *   Resolutions 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15 and 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 are irrelevant; they're for other provinces.\n    *   Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15 is the key, as it's for Sơn La. I've read through it carefully, focusing on lines concerning \"Huyện Mai Sơn\".\n    *   Lines 43 and 47 are interesting, as they clearly show districts are being eliminated and wards being merged or renamed. However, while these lines reference units *within* Huyện Mai Sơn (as implied by the context of the old address and the resolution title), they don't explicitly mention \"Xã Nà Pó\". They create new wards like \"Xã Mai Sơn\" and \"Xã Mường Chanh\", but not \"Xã Nà Pó\".\n\n4.  **Synthesizing the Information:** Here's the crux of the issue:\n    *   The province is the same.\n    *   The resolutions show that Huyện Mai Sơn is being reorganized, with wards being eliminated.\n    *   While there are changes in \"Huyện Mai Sơn\", there's no direct mention of \"Xã Nà Pó\" in the provided context. I have to deduce that these changes likely impacted it.\n    *   The prompt states that \"all districts are eliminated\" and \"Most of the wards have been renamed / split or merged. A small number of the wards are kept unchanged.\"\n    *   Since I don't have a specific line that definitively confirms what happened to \"Xã Nà Pó\", I have two possibilities: it was merged into a new ward, or it remained unchanged. The context of the other ward changes strongly suggests that it *was* merged.\n    *   The question now is, what do I tell the user given that I am missing information? The user asked to \"Find one or multiple new ward that may be the new administrative unit corresponding to the given address.\" and \"If there are insufficient information or otherwise you are not sure, indicate that the confidence is low.\"\n\n5.  **Formulating the Response:** The schema allows an empty array `[]` when no match is found. That seems the most appropriate response here, since there is insufficient information. Since I can't confirm a new name, providing an empty array is the best answer.\n",

The task is to map the old address \\\"Xã Nà Pó, Huyện Mai Sơn, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\" to its new administrative unit, based on the provided resolutions and the list of new wards.\\n\\nFirst, the province is straightforward: \\\"Tỉnh Sơn La.\\\" I'll cross-reference it with Resolution 60-NQ/TW to confirm there hasn't been any province-level merger. The resolution clearly states that \\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\" remains unchanged. Good.\\n\\nNext, I need to understand the fate of \\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\" and \\\"Huyện Mai Sơn.\\\"  The key here is Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with administrative rearrangement within Sơn La. Scanning it, I notice specific examples of wards being merged. \\\"Thị trấn Hát Lót\\\", \\\"xã Hát Lót\\\", and \\\"xã Cò Nòi\\\" are merged into the new ward \\\"Xã Mai Sơn,\\\" according to line 43. Likewise, line 47 dictates the merger of \\\"xã Chiềng Chung\\\" and \\\"xã Mường Chanh\\\" into the new \\\"Xã Mường Chanh.\\\"\\n\\nCrucially, though, \\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\" is *not* explicitly mentioned in this resolution.  I've gone over the text meticulously. It's absent. This absence is a problem.  I need to ascertain what happened to it.\\n\\nThe new wards listed are {\\\"ward_code\\\":\\\"04105\\\",\\\"ward_name\\\":\\\"Xã Mai Sơn\\\",\\\"province_name\\\":\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\"} and {\\\"ward_code\\\":\\\"04117\\\",\\\"ward_name\\\":\\\"Xã Mường Chanh\\\",\\\"province_name\\\":\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\"}. These are the only *candidates* from the given information.  However, they are not *applicable* candidates for *Xã Nà Pó*.  I've scoured the provided text, and \\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned as being subsumed into either of them. The districts are being eliminated in the resolutions, so \\\"Huyện Mai Sơn\\\" no longer exists as a district. Since there's no explicit mapping for \\\"Xã Nà Pó,\\\" I'm left with uncertainty.\\n\\nGiven this lack of clarity, my confidence in providing a definitive mapping for \\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\" is low.  I cannot confidently determine its new administrative unit based on the provided data.  It might have been merged into one of the new wards, been renamed, or remained unchanged. Unfortunately, I don't have enough data to be certain.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\",\n        \"line\": \"5.

My goal is to map the old address \\\\\\\"Xã Nà Pó, Huyện Mai Sơn, Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\" to a new administrative unit based on the provided resolutions and the list of new wards.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the province: it's \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\". I immediately checked Resolution 60-NQ/TW to see if Sơn La was affected by any merges or changes at the provincial level. Thankfully, it's explicitly stated that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\" remains unchanged. Good.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I delved into the specifics of \\\\\\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Huyện Mai Sơn\\\\\\\". Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning administrative unit restructuring in Sơn La, is the key here. Scanning the relevant lines, I found that \\\\\\\"Hát Lót\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Cò Nòi\\\\\\\" merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Mai Sơn\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"Chiềng Chung\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Mường Chanh\\\\\\\" merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chanh\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nHowever, and this is crucial, **\\\\\\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\\\\\" is nowhere to be found in these lines.** It's not explicitly mentioned as being merged into one of the new wards. This is a problem.\\\\n\\\\nI then consulted the \\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\" list. I see \\\\\\\"Xã Mai Sơn\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chanh\\\\\\\", both within \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sơn La\\\\\\\". But again, *nothing* about \\\\\\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nGiven the information provided, and the fact that most wards *have* changed, my conclusion is that there is insufficient evidence to determine the fate of \\\\\\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\\\\\". We can see what happened to wards that were present in the provided text. But the text does not contain the old ward \\\\\\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\\\\\". I am not comfortable making any definitive claims on its new administrative unit. The prompt indicates that \\\\\\\"Huyện Mai Sơn\\\\\\\" no longer exists as a district. Given the text does not mention the fate of \\\\\\\"Xã Nà Pó\\\\\\\", the confidence in any potential new mapping would be low.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, my final output will reflect this uncertainty.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"5.
