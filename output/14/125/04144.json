  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change for \"Xã Phiêng Cằm\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the task of identifying the new administrative unit for \"Xã Phiêng Cằm, Huyện Mai Sơn, Tỉnh Sơn La\".  My initial approach is to rigorously check the provided data, primarily focusing on resolutions and new ward information.\n\nFirst, I quickly confirm that Sơn La province remains unaffected by the broader province-level mergers listed in resolution 60-NQ/TW. This is a quick sanity check to keep the scope focused.\n\nThen, I meticulously examine the other resolutions. 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15 and 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 are immediately dismissed as they pertain to Lào Cai and Nghệ An, respectively. Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Sơn La is the crucial document.  Within this, I find:\n\n*   Resolution 43 creates \"xã Mai Sơn\" from several wards in Mai Son district. This is relevant to the district name, \"Huyện Mai Sơn\" but doesn't directly address the ward in question, \"Xã Phiêng Cằm\".\n*   Crucially, Resolution 46 is explicitly relevant. It dictates that \"xã Chiềng Nơi\" and \"xã Phiêng Cằm\" are merged *to form a new* \"xã Phiêng Cằm\".  This means the name \"Xã Phiêng Cằm\" remains, but its territorial composition and boundaries have changed.  This is a direct indicator of the *new* ward.\n*   Resolution 47 creates \"xã Mường Chanh\", but it is unrelated to \"Xã Phiêng Cằm\".\n\nNext, I cross-reference this with the list of new wards.  The entries for \"Xã Nhôn Mai\" (Nghệ An) and \"Xã Mai Sơn\" (Sơn La) are irrelevant to my target. The appearance of \"Xã Mường Chanh\" (Sơn La) is also quickly discounted. Finally, I identify `{\"ward_code\":\"04144\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Phiêng Cằm\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Sơn La\"}`. This new ward in Sơn La directly matches the original ward name. Combined with Resolution 46, which explicitly described the merging of \"xã Chiềng Nơi\" and \"xã Phiêng Cằm,\" it's clear this is the updated unit I'm looking for.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the *name* of the administrative unit remains \"Xã Phiêng Cằm,\" but its boundaries and population have changed due to the merger with \"xã Chiềng Nơi,\" according to Resolution 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15, Article 46. The new ward is indeed identified in the new ward list. The new information is stored in the new ward table with the information. I have confirmed that the new unit with the same name, \"Xã Phiêng Cằm\" exists in the data.\n",
