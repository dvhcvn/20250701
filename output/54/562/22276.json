  "thought": "**Analyzing and Mapping Administrative Units**\n\nOkay, first things first, I need to understand what the user wants. It's about mapping an old administrative unit, \"Xã Hòa Đồng\" in \"Huyện Tây Hoà, Tỉnh Phú Yên,\" to its new counterpart based on provided resolutions. Got it. I'll break this down.\n\n**Deconstructing the Request:**\n\n*   **The Goal:** Find the new \"ward\" (which could be a commune, ward, or equivalent) that contains the old \"Xã Hòa Đồng.\"\n*   **The Approach:** Review the provided resolutions, identify any mentions of \"Xã Hòa Đồng,\" and then pinpoint the new ward(s) resulting from these resolutions. I'll keep an eye out for mentions of both the ward and the district to ensure a strong match.\n*   **Output:** A JSON array, formatted exactly as specified. Confidence levels will be noted based on the strength of the match.\n\n**Data Analysis:**\n\n*   **Old Ward Context:** \"Xã Hòa Đồng\" is in \"Huyện Tây Hoà, Tỉnh Phú Yên.\" This is my starting point.\n*   **Province Change:** The key here is to realize that \"Tỉnh Phú Yên\" is *now* part of \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" based on a merger resolution. This changes the playing field and focuses my search.\n*   **Resolution Scan:** I'm going through each resolution, looking for any mention of \"Xã Hòa Đồng.\"  The main target is the one for Đắk Lắk (1660/NQ-UBTVQH15).\n    *   **Resolution 1660 (Đắk Lắk):** Bingo! Line 67 is the key: it mentions merging \"xã Hòa Đồng\" into a new \"xã Hòa Thịnh.\" No direct mention of the district, but the context is solid. The fact this is happening within the Đắk Lắk resolution, coupled with the fact that other lines within the same resolution specifically mention \"huyện Tây Hoà,\" strongly suggests a very high probability.\n    *   **Other Resolutions:** The others are irrelevant as there are no other ward mentions.\n\n**Result Synthesis:**\n\n*   \"Xã Hòa Đồng\" in Phú Yên *became* part of Đắk Lắk and merged with \"Xã Hòa Thịnh\" according to resolution 1660. The resolution line \"67\" solidifies this. This is about as direct of a link as one can get.\n*   I confirmed that there is an entry for \"Xã Hòa Thịnh\" in Đắk Lắk in the provided list.\n\n**Output Construction:**\n\nBased on this, I'm constructing the JSON: I'm confident about this match.\n\nThis should be a clean, direct, and accurate mapping. I think I've got it. Let's see how the JSON looks!\n",
