  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit for the Old Address**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My goal is to figure out the new administrative unit for \"Xã Hòa Đồng, Huyện Tây Hoà, Tỉnh Phú Yên.\" First, I need to check if \"Tỉnh Phú Yên\" was merged. Then, I'll dive into ward resolutions, specifically looking for \"Hòa Đồng\" or \"Huyện Tây Hoà,\" especially within the context of the new province. Finally, I'll pinpoint the new ward name and code and gauge my confidence in the mapping.\n\n**Step 1: Province Merger**\n\nI see from the document detailing administrative unit changes that \"Tỉnh Phú Yên\" and \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" were merged into a single \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\" Got it. This is crucial for my search.\n\n**Step 2: Scouring Ward Resolutions**\n\nNow, I'm digging through the \"Other resolutions\" section, focusing on anything related to \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" and the old \"Tỉnh Phú Yên.\"\n\nI'm zeroing in on Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with rearranging administrative units in Đắk Lắk. Here's where it gets interesting:\n\n*   Resolution 67 is a direct hit! It states that \"xã Hòa Đồng\" is merged with \"xã Hòa Thịnh\" to form the new \"xã Hòa Thịnh\". Perfect! This directly answers my question. The resolution explicitly mentions the ward name from my old address, and the result is a specific new ward name. I'm feeling confident about this one.\n*   Resolutions 66 and 69 talk about \"Huyện Tây Hòa\" and the creation of \"Xã Tây Hòa\" and \"Xã Sơn Thành,\" respectively. This suggests the old district is being reorganized as well. It could be that my ward, \"Hòa Đồng,\" was located within \"Huyện Tây Hòa\" and is now part of the new \"xã Hòa Thịnh\" created by Resolution 67.\n\n**Confirming the Mapping**\n\nI quickly checked the `New wards` list, and there it is: `{\"ward_code\":\"22276\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Hòa Thịnh\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"}`. This confirms that \"Xã Hòa Thịnh\" exists.  I also see that \"Xã Tây Hòa\" (ward_code: 22255) exists.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on Resolution 67, the most direct and specific match for \"Xã Hòa Đồng\" is now \"Xã Hòa Thịnh.\" The fact that it's explicitly mentioned in the resolution targeting the province where it was located is crucial. I'm very confident in this mapping. Although other resolution mentions \"Huyện Tây Hòa\" (the old district), the ward's direct mapping to \"Xã Hòa Thịnh\" makes it the correct result.\n",
