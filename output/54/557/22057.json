  "thought": "**Analyzing the Restructuring of \"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\"**\n\nGiven the task of identifying the new administrative unit for the old ward \"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\", I began by meticulously analyzing the information provided. Recognizing that \"Tỉnh Phú Yên\" had merged into \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW, my focus shifted to the resolutions related to Đắk Lắk, specifically Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15.\n\nInitial analysis of the resolution revealed two potential candidates. Line 57 mentioned a merger of \"xã Xuân Hải\" and \"xã Xuân Lộc\" to create a new \"xã Xuân Lộc,\" aligning with the ward's name. However, the resolution didn't explicitly specify that this \"xã Xuân Lộc\" was the one from \"Thị xã Sông Cầu,\" introducing initial ambiguity. Line 93, on the other hand, detailed the creation of a new \"phường Sông Cầu\" through the merger of units from the old Sông Cầu district. While this was very relevant to the case, and the prompt, line 93 did *not* include the old ward \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" in the list.\n\nThe next consideration was to reconcile this with the fact that the old district \"Thị xã Sông Cầu\" *no longer exists* at an administrative level. This is key, because the prompt stated that the \"Vietnamese government has issued resolutions that restructure administrative units, eliminating all districts.\" I hypothesized that the old \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" ward would have been incorporated into a new administrative unit.\n\nThe first possibility considered was the new \"Phường Sông Cầu\". While the name suggested a strong connection to the old district, the resolution text explicitly listed the incorporated units, and \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" was *not* among them. Based on a strict interpretation of the text, this was not the new unit, though the name was very suspicious, suggesting the district's area remains as a coherent unit.\n\nThe second possibility was the new \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" created by the merger of \"xã Xuân Hải\" and \"xã Xuân Lộc\" in Line 57. This new ward's name and location (now Đắk Lắk) matched the target, yet the resolution didn't explicitly link it to the ward from \"Thị xã Sông Cầu,\" raising concerns about whether this was indeed the correct unit. It did not provide district context to confirm the exact location of the old ward that I was looking for.\n\nI further analyzed the wording of these resolutions and the provided text. The units are clearly defined. In order to identify the ward for the old location, and given the prompt \"The Vietnamese government has issued resolutions that restructure administrative units, eliminating all districts.\" the name \"Phường Sông Cầu\" and the old district of Thị xã Sông Cầu had to be taken into account. I considered that it might refer to the area of the old town, regardless of whether all units were directly mentioned. After deeper analysis, and given the fact that the resolution mentions several wards from the old \"Thị xã Sông Cầu\" being merged into a *new* \"phường Sông Cầu\", I did not rule out this possibility. It remains a possible unit for the old location.\n\nDue to the lack of explicit confirmation from the provided resolution and the conflicting clues, I found myself with low confidence in each candidate and considered a strict interpretation of the text. Because there was not enough information, and the new ward name corresponded to the old location, I identified two possible candidates, despite their ambiguities.\n\nThe most likely candidate: is \"Phường Sông Cầu\" or \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" - I concluded that these had a low likelihood of corresponding to the new unit for \"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\", but it was unclear.\n\nIn summary, the most accurate response is a JSON array containing the following two objects, each with low confidence:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"citation\": {\n      \"header\": \"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\",\n      \"line\": \"93.
