Recognizing that \"Tỉnh Phú Yên\" had merged into \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW, my focus shifted to the resolutions related to Đắk Lắk, specifically Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15.\n\nInitial analysis of the resolution revealed two potential candidates. Line 57 mentioned a merger of \"xã Xuân Hải\" and \"xã Xuân Lộc\" to create a new \"xã Xuân Lộc,\" aligning with the ward's name. However, the resolution didn't explicitly specify that this \"xã Xuân Lộc\" was the one from \"Thị xã Sông Cầu,\" introducing initial ambiguity. Line 93, on the other hand, detailed the creation of a new \"phường Sông Cầu\" through the merger of units from the old Sông Cầu district. While this was very relevant to the case, and the prompt, line 93 did *not* include the old ward \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" in the list.\n\nThe next consideration was to reconcile this with the fact that the old district \"Thị xã Sông Cầu\" *no longer exists* at an administrative level. This is key, because the prompt stated that the \"Vietnamese government has issued resolutions that restructure administrative units, eliminating all districts.\" I hypothesized that the old \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" ward would have been incorporated into a new administrative unit.\n\nThe first possibility considered was the new \"Phường Sông Cầu\". While the name suggested a strong connection to the old district, the resolution text explicitly listed the incorporated units, and \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" was *not* among them. Based on a strict interpretation of the text, this was not the new unit, though the name was very suspicious, suggesting the district's area remains as a coherent unit.\n\nThe second possibility was the new \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" created by the merger of \"xã Xuân Hải\" and \"xã Xuân Lộc\" in Line 57. This new ward's name and location (now Đắk Lắk) matched the target, yet the resolution didn't explicitly link it to the ward from \"Thị xã Sông Cầu,\" raising concerns about whether this was indeed the correct unit. It did not provide district context to confirm the exact location of the old ward that I was looking for.\n\nI further analyzed the wording of these resolutions and the provided text. The units are clearly defined. In order to identify the ward for the old location, and given the prompt \"The Vietnamese government has issued resolutions that restructure administrative units, eliminating all districts.\" the name \"Phường Sông Cầu\" and the old district of Thị xã Sông Cầu had to be taken into account. I considered that it might refer to the area of the old town, regardless of whether all units were directly mentioned. After deeper analysis, and given the fact that the resolution mentions several wards from the old \"Thị xã Sông Cầu\" being merged into a *new* \"phường Sông Cầu\", I did not rule out this possibility. It remains a possible unit for the old location.\n\nDue to the lack of explicit confirmation from the provided resolution and the conflicting clues, I found myself with low confidence in each candidate and considered a strict interpretation of the text. Because there was not enough information, and the new ward name corresponded to the old location, I identified two possible candidates, despite their ambiguities.\n\nThe most likely candidate: is \"Phường Sông Cầu\" or \"Xã Xuân Lộc\" - I concluded that these had a low likelihood of corresponding to the new unit for \"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\", but it was unclear.\n\nIn summary, the most accurate response is a JSON array containing the following two objects, each with low confidence:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"citation\": {\n      \"header\": \"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\",\n      \"line\": \"93.

My task is to find the new administrative unit for the old ward \\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\" in \\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\". First, I need to keep in mind that the government has been eliminating districts in this round of restructuring.\\n\\nI started by analyzing the old administrative setup: \\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\" in the district \\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\" of the province \\\"Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\". I knew I had to determine the new province, as the old one, \\\"Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\", was merged. Based on the 60-NQ/TW resolutions, the province \\\"Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\" is now part of \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\". This means I need to focus on resolutions related to \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\".\\n\\nThe relevant resolution for Đắk Lắk is 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning the restructuring of administrative units. I carefully examined the lines in this resolution, looking for any mentions of \\\"Xã Xuân Lộc.\\\" Line 57 caught my attention: it describes the merger of \\\"xã Xuân Hải\\\" and \\\"xã Xuân Lộc\\\" to form a new \\\"xã Xuân Lộc.\\\" This seemed promising, but it didn't specify the district.\\n\\nHowever, line 93 also gave me a strong hint: It reorganizes wards from what was likely the old \\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\" into a new \\\"phường Sông Cầu.\\\" The fact that the old unit included \\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\" increased the liklihood that this part of the resolution was relevant.  \\\"phường Xuân Yên, phường Xuân Phú, xã Xuân Phương và xã Xuân Thịnh\\\" were mentioned as being merged into the new \\\"phường Sông Cầu\\\". But crucially, \\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\" was *not* on that list. So, while it pointed to extensive reorganization, \\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\" wasn't directly part of that merger.\\n\\nThis made things complicated. The resolution mentions a new \\\"phường Sông Cầu\\\" being formed. If districts are being eliminated, it's highly likely that this reorganization affects wards within the old \\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\". However, there's also the merger mentioned in line 57 to consider.  I need to re-evaluate based on the goal of finding the new unit for \\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\".\\n\\nBased on my analysis of the available data, considering that districts are being eliminated, the most logical match is the merger described in line 57 of resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: \\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\" was merged with \\\"xã Xuân Hải\\\" to create a new \\\"xã Xuân Lộc\\\". While the new district is not specified, given the elimination of districts, it must be part of the new system.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"22051\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Phường Sông Cầu\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 16724,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0031937000000000003,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Finding the New Administrative Unit for Xã Xuân Lộc**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm looking for the new administrative location of \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên.\\\\\\\" First things first, the province changed. I know from Resolution 60-NQ/TW that Phú Yên was merged with Đắk Lắk, making the new province Đắk Lắk. Now, I need to sift through resolutions to find what happened to \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\" specifically.\\\\n\\\\nInitially, I zeroed in on Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with administrative changes in Đắk Lắk. Line 57 caught my eye; it mentions merging \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Hải\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\" to form a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\". That's a strong lead, considering the province change.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, I also noticed something in the same resolution (line 93). This particular line reorganized units within what was the old \\\\\\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\\\\\" – which is directly relevant to my initial search, remember? Line 93 is about merging \\\\\\\"phường Xuân Yên, phường Xuân Phú, xã Xuân Phương và xã Xuân Thịnh\\\\\\\" to form a \\\\\\\"phường Sông Cầu.\\\\\\\" That's telling because it seems like the units in the old \\\\\\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\\\\\" were being reshaped significantly. Importantly, my input ward \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\" *wasn't* listed in that reorganization.\\\\n\\\\nI went back and re-examined the information. I had the old ward name, old district name, and old province name: \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\\\\\". Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 57 does *indeed* create a \\\\\\\"xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\" via a merger between \\\\\\\"xã Xuân Hải\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\". This *is* the resolution for the new province, as needed.\\\\n\\\\nBased on my analysis, it seems that \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\\\\\" *did* become a \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\" in Đắk Lắk, via the merger with \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Hải\\\\\\\". The old district, \\\\\\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\\\\\", likely had its administrative units reorganized according to Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15. I'm confident that the new administrative location for the old \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\" is the newly formed \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\" in Đắk Lắk.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"22051\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Phường Sông Cầu\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 15324,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0035737,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Mapping**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, here's what I've got. I need to figure out the current administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc, Thị xã Sông Cầu, Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I know I'm dealing with changes in province and potentially district/ward designations, which requires a deep dive into relevant resolutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" according to Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This means my focus shifts to Đắk Lắk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, I focused on resolutions, specifically 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15. I've found a couple of interesting clues.  Line 57 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being formed from other communes, which is promising. However, it doesn't specify which *district*. Then, Line 93 mentions the creation of a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Here's where it gets tricky: My original address was in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but districts have been eliminated.  Could \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" now be a *phường*? Perhaps, but given the input, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is not part of this merge. Looking at the inputs, I need to assume my target ward is distinct from the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, I re-examined the other entries, particularly line 57 that mentions the merge to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This looks promising as it's the exact name of my target. But I still need to determine the *district*.  This is where I need to dig deeper into the merging information in Resolution 1660. The challenge is connecting the old ward to the new administrative structure of Đắk Lắk. I need to look for further resolutions or data to map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" under the new provincial structure of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and, importantly, what its new corresponding *district* would be.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"93.

First things first, breaking down the address helps: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the province. The district is less crucial here, but it helps with context.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI've got a pile of resolutions to sift through. Immediately, I see **60-NQ/TW** which tells me Phú Yên has merged into Đắk Lắk. That's a huge clue! So, my initial thought is, the province for this \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now *definitely* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm diving deeper, looking for specific changes to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the area. Resolution **1660/NQ-UBTVQH15** is the most promising. It mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the context of Đắk Lắk. But it's a bit ambiguous, because the resolution talks about merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to *create* a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I need to be careful; this could be for a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *already* in Đắk Lắk *or* the one from Phú Yên that was absorbed. I'm noting this is potentially a relevant reference that I will investigate further.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, I check the new wards data. Bingo! I find `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"22057\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`. This suggests a newly established unit which fits.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, Resolution **1660/NQ-UBTVQH15** references \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which is quite relevant considering our original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  I'm thinking, did the district get dissolved and reconstituted as something else? I check the new wards and find `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"22051\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Phường Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`. Very interesting. This means \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *is* now a ward!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**Conclusion:** I have a strong hunch.

First, I've got to understand the old structure. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xuân Lộc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Sông Cầu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the district-level city, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the province.  I know districts can be dissolved, and I need to prioritize province-level changes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe resolutions are where the answers are.
