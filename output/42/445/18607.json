  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit for a Given Address**\n\nOkay, so I've got this old address: \"Xã Thạch Long, Huyện Thạch Hà, Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh.\" My goal is to figure out the new administrative unit it corresponds to. First, I need to break down the old address. I see \"Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh\" for the province and \"Xã Thạch Long\" for the ward.\n\nNow, I'll go through the provided resolutions. I know I have to check the province resolutions first. Luckily, Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh remains unchanged. That makes it easier! The province stays as \"Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh.\"\n\nNext, I'll focus on finding \"Xã Thạch Long\" in the \"Other resolutions.\" I found two potential resolutions, but only Resolution 1 is relevant because it's about Hà Tĩnh province. Scanning through this resolution, I see line 19 explicitly mentions \"Xã Thạch Long\" and says it's being merged into \"Xã Thạch Hà.\" This looks promising!\n\nHowever, I need to make sure. I found another resolution, which also mentions \"Xã Thạch Long,\" but it's for \"tỉnh Thanh Hóa.\" That's not helpful here. It's important to be careful and make sure the resolutions match the given province.\n\nOkay, back to resolution 1. Based on my analysis, \"Xã Thạch Long\" from \"Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh\" is merged into \"xã Thạch Hà\" according to resolution \"1665/NQ-UBTVQH15\", line 19.\n\nNow that I've identified the new ward, I'll need to double-check that it is present in the \"New wards\" list, in the correct province. I find \"xã Thạch Hà\" with code \"18562\" in \"Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh.\" Perfect! That matches perfectly, and it strengthens my conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the new ward is \"Xã Thạch Hà\" with code \"18562\" in \"Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh,\" and the citation is resolution \"1665/NQ-UBTVQH15\", line 19. My confidence here is \"high\" because I found a clear, direct mapping in the correct resolution for the correct province. I am confident in this finding.\n\nNow, I'm ready to construct the JSON output. I'll make sure it includes the citation, the confidence level, the province name, the ward code, and the ward name.\n",
