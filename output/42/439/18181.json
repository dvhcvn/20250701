  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \"Xã Tân Mỹ Hà, Huyện Hương Sơn, Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh\" and the task of determining its current administrative location. My process is pretty straightforward, leveraging my knowledge of administrative reorganizations.\n\nFirst, I identified \"Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh\" as the province. I immediately checked for any province-level merges or divisions based on the 60-NQ/TW resolution. Fortunately, Hà Tĩnh wasn't affected – it remains intact.\n\nNext, I delved into other resolutions, specifically focusing on those dealing with administrative changes within Hà Tĩnh. I quickly zeroed in on 1665/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns itself with restructuring commune-level units within the province.\n\nI meticulously scanned through this resolution, line by line, looking for any mention of \"Xã Tân Mỹ Hà.\" And there it was! Line 44 explicitly states the merging of \"Tân Mỹ Hà\" with Châu Bình and Mỹ Long, forming the new unit \"Xã Tứ Mỹ.\"  It's a direct reference, making the mapping clear.\n\nJust to be thorough, I checked a few other lines, but no further references to \"Tân Mỹ Hà\" were found. With this strong evidence, I now know the new unit's name.\n\nFinally, I cross-referenced the \"New wards\" list to confirm \"Xã Tứ Mỹ\" within \"Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh\" and retrieve its associated code, which is \"18202.\" This ensures data integrity.\n\nMy JSON output will then clearly reflect this: I'll maintain the province as \"Tỉnh Hà Tĩnh\" (unchanged), present \"Xã Tứ Mỹ\" as the new ward name, include the code \"18202\", and, crucially, cite 1665/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 44, as the supporting resolution and line from the text which provides the information needed. With the direct mention, I'm confident in assigning a \"high\" confidence level to this identification. This should provide a very reliable answer to the original query.\n",
