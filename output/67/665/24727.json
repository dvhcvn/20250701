  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I need to identify the new administrative unit for the old ward \"Xã Đắk N'Dung, Huyện Đắk Song, Tỉnh Đắk Nông\". I know that \"Tỉnh Đắk Nông\" has been merged into \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\" according to Resolution 60-NQ/TW.  The district \"Huyện Đắk Song\" is now obsolete. The problem states all districts are gone, which forces me to look for a resolution that mentions this old district, now possibly a new ward.\n\nAfter reviewing the resolutions, `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15` for \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\" is the relevant one.  Line 88 mentions the creation of \"Xã Đắk Song\" by merging \"Xã Đắk Môl\" and \"Xã Đắk Hòa\". However, it doesn't explicitly mention \"Xã Đắk N'Dung.\"\n\nNext, I looked at a list and confirmed there is a ward \"Xã Đắk Song\" in \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\" with the code \"24718\". The name \"Đắk Song\" is the same as the old district. I know that the old province is now part of the new province and that my answer has to be in the new province.\n\nWhile it's logical to assume \"Xã Đắk N'Dung\" from the old district \"Huyện Đắk Song\" is part of the new \"Xã Đắk Song\" in \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\", there is no direct confirmation. The provided text doesn't explicitly state what happened to the old ward.\n\nTherefore, although I strongly suspect the new ward is \"Xã Đắk Song\" in \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\", with a ward code of \"24718\", I must set a \"low\" confidence because of the lack of direct evidence in the texts that the old ward \"Xã Đắk N'Dung\" was merged. I can cite the merger resolution (60-NQ/TW) and the relevant part of resolution 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15 for the creation of the new ward, but no direct source for the specific ward. The final JSON will include the proposed ward, province name, ward code, confidence, and a citation to the relevant portion of Resolution 1671.\n",

This means I need to dig through these resolutions and figure out where this old ward ended up.\\n\\nFirst, I break it down. I know I'm looking for the new ward(s) encompassing the old \\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\". I've got resolutions detailing provincial mergers and ward-level changes. The output needs to be a nice JSON array, with province, ward name, ward code, confidence level, and citation for each possible match.\\n\\nI've got the old ward's name and its parent district and province, so \\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung, Huyện Đắk Song, Tỉnh Đắk Nông.\\\"\\n\\nNow, it's time to follow the trail. I start with resolution `60-NQ/TW` and look at province mergers. Hey, Bingo! It's right there: Đắk Nông merged with Lâm Đồng and Bình Thuận, with the new name being Lâm Đồng. That's a huge clue; I can limit my search to Lâm Đồng province now.\\n\\nSince the user mentioned that all the old districts have been eliminated, I'll need to figure out which modern wards emerged from the old district. I start by checking the resolution `1664/NQ-UBTVQH15` but soon realize this one focuses on Gia Lai province, so it's not relevant.\\n\\nMoving on to `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which details changes in Lâm Đồng. This looks promising. Ah, here's an important one: it mentions the creation of a \\\"Xã Đắk Song\\\" by merging other wards. This is interesting. While it *doesn't* specifically mention \\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung,\\\" it does seem to name the ward after the old district, indicating a strong possibility. It's likely that a ward was named after the old district.\\n\\nSo, while I don't have a direct *confirmation* in these resolutions, the province merger and the naming pattern suggest that a *very likely* candidate for \\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\" is the new \\\"Xã Đắk Song\\\" in Tỉnh Lâm Đồng. I'll need to flag the confidence accordingly and provide the necessary citation. I am ready to construct the JSON output now.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"24718\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Đắk Song\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung, Huyện Đắk Song, Tỉnh Đắk Nông\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 15925,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0033168,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Mapping Vietnamese Administrative Units: A Complex Case**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I've got an old address to map: `Xã Đắk N'Dung, Huyện Đắk Song, Tỉnh Đắk Nông`. My goal is to find the corresponding new administrative unit(s). The user is providing me with a few clues, so let's see what we can piece together.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I parsed the old address. It's in Đắk Nông province, Đắk Song district, and Đắk N'Dung ward.  My first task is to see what happened to Đắk Nông, so I look for province-level changes. It's a bit complicated, but it looks like Đắk Nông was merged into Lâm Đồng.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I look at the ward and district resolutions provided. There are two: one for Gia Lai and one for Lâm Đồng. The one for Gia Lai is irrelevant since the address is in the new Lâm Đồng. The resolution for Lâm Đồng *does* create a new ward called \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Song,\\\\\\\" but it does it by merging Đắk Môl and Đắk Hòa. This leaves me with a problem:  the resolution *doesn't* mention Đắk N'Dung!\\\\n\\\\nHere's the problem: The old district was \\\\\\\"Huyện Đắk Song,\\\\\\\" and now there's a new ward also named \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Song\\\\\\\" in the new province of Lâm Đồng. It's quite common for new wards to be named after their former districts, particularly after a re-organization. Plus, the old ward, Đắk N'Dung, *was* part of the old Đắk Song district. It's highly likely that Đắk N'Dung was *incorporated* into this new Đắk Song ward as part of the re-organization, but the available resolution doesn't explicitly state that. It only mentions the merger of Đắk Môl and Đắk Hòa. The information is incomplete and requires further investigation to ensure accuracy. I would need more comprehensive resolutions to confirm the exact new mapping.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"24718\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Đắk Song\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung, Huyện Đắk Song, Tỉnh Đắk Nông\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 7682,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0028217999999999997,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Assessing the Administrative Changes for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I've been tasked with mapping the old administrative unit \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (in Huyện Đắk Song, Tỉnh Đắk Nông) to its new equivalent, based on these resolutions and new ward data.  My analysis started by confirming the old province and ward: Tỉnh Đắk Nông and Xã Đắk N'Dung, respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step was to check if Tỉnh Đắk Nông had been modified. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Tỉnh Đắk Nông has been merged into Tỉnh Lâm Đồng, which is important. Now I know that I will look for Xã Đắk N'Dung in Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I thoroughly examined the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" provided. I was looking for any mention of Xã Đắk N'Dung, or any clues about its fate in the changes. Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, for Tỉnh Gia Lai, mentions wards, but those are in Gia Lai, so not relevant. Resolution 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15 mentions Đắk Môl and Đắk Hòa forming a new Xã Đắk Song in Tỉnh Lâm Đồng, but that is not Xã Đắk N'Dung. There was no explicit mention of Xã Đắk N'Dung in these resolutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen I reviewed the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data, checking for any wards in Tỉnh Lâm Đồng that might correspond to Xã Đắk N'Dung.  There was a new Xã Đắk Song listed in Tỉnh Lâm Đồng, which looks promising at first, but upon further analysis, this new Xã Đắk Song was formed from Đắk Môl and Đắk Hòa, *not* Xã Đắk N'Dung.  There was also a Xã Đăk Song in Tỉnh Gia Lai, but that's in the wrong province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the data, the old province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Nông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is indeed now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, I couldn't find a resolution specifically detailing what happened to Xã Đắk N'Dung. The resolutions and the new ward data only provided information about other wards, not Xã Đắk N'Dung. None of these show the split, merger, or renaming of Xã Đắk N'Dung.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the available data and the instructions, I am not able to determine the new ward corresponding to Xã Đắk N'Dung. There is insufficient information to make a confident mapping. I would have to set my confidence as low. Therefore, I can't return any specific new ward for Xã Đắk N'Dung.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung, Huyện Đắk Song, Tỉnh Đắk Nông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8658,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0028217999999999997,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Assessing the Mapping of an Old Ward to New Administrative Units**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with a task: to translate an old address, specifically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung, Huyện Đắk Song, Tỉnh Đắk Nông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", into its new administrative structure. Let's break this down systematically.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the key components of the old address: the ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Nông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Then, I dove into the provided resolutions to see if the province experienced any changes. Resolution 60-NQ/TW revealed that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Nông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been absorbed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I needed to check if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" itself had undergone any transformations. I scoured the other resolutions, like 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15 and 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15, looking for any mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or related entities within the area. However, the resolutions I was provided mainly detailed changes for other wards, like the formation of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Song\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" through the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Pling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Song\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (for Tỉnh Gia Lai) or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đắk Môl\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đắk Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (for Tỉnh Lâm Đồng). There was no direct information related to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, I shifted my focus to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data. I scanned the entries to see if any ward corresponded to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the new province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The dataset did contain a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Song\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but it was linked to a combination of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đắk Môl\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đắk Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConsidering all these factors, here's my analysis. The old province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Nông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", has merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, I didn't find any specific resolution detailing the fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". While the resolutions and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data provide details about changes in other wards, none directly address or provide a new name for the ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Moreover, the instructions indicate that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"If there are insufficient information or otherwise you are not sure, indicate that the confidence is low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConsequently, given the provided data, I have insufficient information to confidently map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk N'Dung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new ward. The confidence level is low.
