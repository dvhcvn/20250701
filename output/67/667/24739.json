  "thought": "**Address Mapping Analysis: Đắk Búk So to Tuy Đức**\n\nOkay, here's my analysis of this address transformation. It's clear the user needs a precise mapping based on available data, specifically provincial and local resolutions, and updated ward information.\n\nMy thought process is this: First, I meticulously extracted the key components from the input address: \"Xã Đắk Búk So\" as the old ward and \"Tỉnh Đắk Nông\" as the old province. Immediately, I recognized the need to check for any province mergers, which is a common administrative change. Resolution 60-NQ/TW confirmed that \"Tỉnh Đắk Nông\" was merged into \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\". This is critical, as it changes the entire provincial context.\n\nNext, I focused on the specific ward. Digging into other resolutions, I hit paydirt with 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15, a resolution explicitly addressing the restructuring of wards *within* Lâm Đồng.  Line 95 of that resolution was crucial: it definitively stated that \"Xã Đắk Búk So\" was merged, along with others, into a *new* ward called \"Xã Tuy Đức.\" The header of the resolution was a good confirmation as it referred to the province \"Lâm Đồng\", the new province from the resolution 60-NQ/TW.\n\nHaving found that direct connection, I then cross-referenced this against the provided \"New Wards\" data. And indeed, there was a perfect match: a record for \"Xã Tuy Đức\" in \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\" with the ward code \"24739.\" This solidified the connection.\n\nGiven the direct, unambiguous references in the resolutions, I'm confident in the mapping. It's a clear-cut case of an old ward being absorbed into a new one due to provincial and local restructuring. The user now has a well-justified and accurate address mapping. This level of meticulousness is essential for my work in these situations.\n",
