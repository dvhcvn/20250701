I need to figure out the new administrative unit for \"Phường Thuỷ Đường, Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên, Thành phố Hải Phòng.\" My first step, as always, is to break down the input. I have the old ward (\"Phường Thuỷ Đường\"), the old district (\"Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên\"), and the old province (\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\").\n\nNow, the resolutions. I'm seeing that there's been some merging and renaming. Specifically, the \"60-NQ/TW\" resolution states that Hải Dương province and Hải Phòng city have merged, becoming \"Thành phố Hải Phòng.\"  So, the province level has been affected, but the name is retained, which is good to know. The crucial detail is that \"Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên\" has been eliminated as a district.  And the prompt specifically mentions that wards are being renamed, split, or merged.\n\nThe real problem is the complete lack of specific information about \"Phường Thuỷ Đường.\"  My provided lists of other resolutions and new wards are empty.  Zero.  Nada.  Without this crucial information, I can't determine if \"Phường Thuỷ Đường\" has been renamed, absorbed, or remains unchanged.\n\nSynthesizing this, I know the new province is still \"Thành phố Hải Phòng,\" but the district is gone.  Since the fate of the ward is unknown, I'm stuck. I can't generate a new ward name or code out of thin air.  Therefore, my confidence in providing a definitive answer is low.\n\nMy output will reflect this uncertainty. I'll provide the province name as \"Thành phố Hải Phòng,\" set the ward name and code to null, and flag the low confidence.  I'll also cite the province-level resolution that states the merging. This is the best I can do with the current data. The JSON structure will be accurate and valid, reflecting my best interpretation.\n",

The first thing I did was break it down: old ward, old district, old province.  Knowing my subject, I immediately flagged the elimination of districts. I've got to consider resolution 60-NQ/TW which governs this restructuring.\\\\n\\\\nI looked at the merging of province-level units. Crucially, item 7 states that \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hải Dương và thành phố Hải Phòng, lấy tên là thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\".  So, the *name* of the province-level unit remains the same (\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\"), but it's now larger, including the former province of Hải Dương.\\\\n\\\\nThe next thing I did was check for specific resolutions regarding ward-level changes within Hải Phòng, but found nothing.  The provided list is empty, which is a significant clue. Similarly, the list of new wards is also empty, which is even more telling. I have zero information on how Phường Thuỷ Đường was treated.\\\\n\\\\nPutting it all together, I can definitively say that the province is now the \\\\\\\"merged\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\". However, the old district \\\\\\\"Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên\\\\\\\" is eliminated.  Because the lists for ward-level changes are empty, I have no idea if Phường Thuỷ Đường still exists in its current form. It might be renamed, merged, or split.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, I have to output the \\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\" as the province, but I'm unable to say anything about the ward itself.  My confidence level is low because of the data gap.  I'll cite the relevant resolution: 60-NQ/TW, specifically the line \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hải Dương và thành phố Hải Phòng, lấy tên là thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\". My conclusion rests on the absence of information: I have no new ward data, thus my lack of confidence in identifying a specific ward name or code.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường, Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên, Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 7950,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0023058,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Mapping Vietnamese Address to New Administrative Units: Analysis and Conclusion**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường, Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên, Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on the resolutions provided.  My initial step is to identify the province, which is clearly \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  I immediately check Resolution 60-NQ/TW to see how that's affected.  Section 7 tells me that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the result of a merger with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tỉnh Hải Dương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So the province name remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I need to keep this in mind as I proceed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to focus on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The problem explicitly states that all districts will be eliminated. I know \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a district-level city. So, it's safe to say it's going away as a separate entity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I check the provided data for specifics on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The section for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is empty: `[]`.  The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" section is also empty: `[]`.  This is a significant hurdle.  With no specific resolutions addressing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", I'm effectively left with a blank slate.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe prompt does state that most wards have been renamed/split/merged, and that I have access to resolutions. However, without any specific information on this particular ward and given the elimination of the district, I'm at a dead end. I'm operating under the assumption that if the resolution existed it would have been provided.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, given the lack of concrete evidence – no \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" information and no other relevant resolutions – I have to conclude that I cannot determine the new ward name or code.  The instructions are clear that if I lack confidence, I should state so.  The confidence here is undeniably low.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nEven though I cannot determine a new ward, the output schema *requires* that I populate the `ward_code` and `ward_name` fields. Considering the instructions and the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" declaration, I believe the appropriate action is to populate with a value that indicates an unknown result.  I need to show the inability to resolve this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe JSON will look like this:\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"7.

The user is asking me to find the new administrative location for this old Vietnamese address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường, Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên, Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I need to figure out what \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has become.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the province. Using the provided 60-NQ/TW resolutions, I can see that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *remains* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, the resolution *does* say it merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tỉnh Hải Dương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This doesn't change the province name, but it is important to remember for context. My citation for that is section 7 of 60-NQ/TW.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe problem specifically mentions that districts are being eliminated. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a district-level unit. Therefore, it's safe to assume it's being removed. Now, the crucial part: I have *no* information about what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". There are no \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" listed (`[]`) and no other relevant resolutions (`[]`).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe problem statement mentions renamings, splits, and mergers, and that I have access to a database of these changes. Since I have absolutely nothing specific about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Thuỷ Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the data, I can't determine the new ward name or code. The data indicates that most of the wards are changed but, I can't find anything related to the specific name I need. The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list is empty.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI must conclude that there is insufficient information to map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Đường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The confidence level has to be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The province name will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" thanks to the resolution.
