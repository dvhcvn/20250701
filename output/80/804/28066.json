  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the current administrative unit for \"Xã Mỹ Phú, Huyện Thủ Thừa, Tỉnh Long An\". Let's break this down systematically. First, I recognize the components: ward, district, and province.\n\nMy initial thought is to check for province-level changes. I know about the recent resolutions.  I recall `60-NQ/TW` mentioning a merger of Long An and Tây Ninh provinces, forming the new \"Tỉnh Tây Ninh.\" This is key.\n\nNow, I'll need to pinpoint any ward-level adjustments. I immediately think of the resolutions related to the new province. Based on the request, `1682/NQ-UBTVQH15` seems like the relevant document dealing with the reorganization of *Tỉnh Tây Ninh's* communes (xã).\n\nI'll carefully review the lines of `1682/NQ-UBTVQH15`, focusing on any mentions of \"Xã Mỹ Phú.\" Scanning the document, I find something interesting on line 21: it explicitly states that the entire area and population of \"Xã Mỹ Phú\" were merged with \"Xã Mỹ An\" to become the new \"Xã Mỹ An.\" Bingo!\n\nLooking further at lines 20, 22, 23, and 84 I do not find any further mentioning of \"Xã Mỹ Phú\".\n\nFrom this, I'm confident that \"Xã Mỹ Phú\" is now part of \"Xã Mỹ An.\"  Since Long An is now part of Tây Ninh, and looking at the \"New Wards\" list, I need to get the \"Xã Mỹ An\" code. Let's see... Ah! I've found it: `{\"ward_code\":\"28066\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Mỹ An\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\"}`. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, \"Xã Mỹ Phú\" is now \"Xã Mỹ An, Tỉnh Tây Ninh\" with code \"28066.\"  My confidence in this is high, as the resolution explicitly states the complete merger.  My citation will be from resolution `1682/NQ-UBTVQH15`, line 21, which clearly states this restructuring. My logic seems to hold up. I'm ready to craft the JSON output now.\n",

My initial thought is to tackle this step-by-step. First, I need to check for province mergers. The information points me to Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which indicates Long An was merged into Tây Ninh. So, I'm now looking at Tây Ninh.\\n\\nNext, I need to locate \\\"Xã Mỹ Phú\\\" within resolutions concerning Tây Ninh (or the old Long An). I start by examining the `Other resolutions` section. Scanning through, I find Resolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15, and there it is: \\\"Xã Mỹ Phú.\\\"\\n\\nThe crucial line is line 21, stating that \\\"Xã Mỹ Phú\\\" is being merged with \\\"Xã Mỹ An\\\" to form a new \\\"Xã Mỹ An\\\". Excellent!  However, a deeper dive is necessary.  The problem is, line 21 *doesn't* specify the district (huyện) for \\\"Xã Mỹ Phú\\\".  Other lines in the same resolution *do* specify \\\"Huyện Thủ Thừa\\\" for other units from that district. I need to be absolutely sure this Mỹ Phú is the one the user is asking about.\\n\\nI'm now meticulously rereading Resolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15. I notice lines 20, 22, 23, and 84 all *explicitly* reference \\\"huyện Thủ Thừa\\\" for units from that district. Line 21, concerning Mỹ Phú, doesn't. This raises a red flag. Is the Mỹ Phú in this resolution *really* the one from Thủ Thừa? The context of province mergers does make me consider the possibility. But the lack of district specification in line 21 strongly suggests a different scenario. My expert understanding of these administrative structures tells me that the absence of a district identifier, in this context, is highly significant.  It's unlikely this resolution pertains to the specific \\\"Xã Mỹ Phú, Huyện Thủ Thừa\\\" the user is interested in. I need to continue the search, keeping in mind this vital detail.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\",\n        \"line\": \"18.

Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Long An is now part of Tây Ninh.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I need to hunt for \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Phú\\\\\\\" in relevant resolutions, specifically those from Tây Ninh (the new province) or even older ones from Long An. I'm focusing on the \\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\" section. I'm going through each resolution's text, line by line, looking for \\\\\\\"Mỹ Phú.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nResolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Tây Ninh, catches my eye. Line 21 in this resolution mentions \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Phú.\\\\\\\"  Crucially, it says \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Mỹ Phú và xã Mỹ An thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Mỹ An**.\\\\\\\"  So, it seems \\\\\\\"Mỹ Phú\\\\\\\" is merging into \\\\\\\"Mỹ An.\\\\\\\"  However, and this is where it gets tricky, this line doesn't explicitly mention \\\\\\\"Huyện Thủ Thừa.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow, this resolution *does* include mentions of \\\\\\\"huyện Thủ Thừa\\\\\\\" in other lines. Lines 20, 22, 23, and 84, for example, specify \\\\\\\"huyện Thủ Thừa\\\\\\\" when referring to units within that district. This absence in line 21, and the presence in others, makes me question whether *this* \\\\\\\"Mỹ Phú\\\\\\\" is the one from Thủ Thừa.  If it *was* the Mỹ Phú from Thủ Thừa, shouldn't the resolution have been more explicit? Given the focus on province mergers in this process, it's possible these are separate units.  I'm going to carefully re-read the entire resolution to confirm my assessment.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"18.
