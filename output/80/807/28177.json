  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Address Change**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user's asking about \"Xã Mỹ Lộc, Huyện Cần Giuộc, Tỉnh Long An\".  First things first, I need to figure out what happened to \"Tỉnh Long An\" based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW.  Ah, right, Long An was merged into Tây Ninh. So, we're now dealing with the area formerly known as Long An, now part of Tây Ninh.\n\nThe tricky part is \"Xã Mỹ Lộc\". Since \"Mỹ Lộc\" is common, I need to be careful to identify the correct administrative unit.  I've checked a series of resolutions. Nothing jumped out right away.  Several resolutions mentioned \"Mỹ Lộc\" in other provinces like Gia Lai, Hà Tĩnh, Hưng Yên, and Ninh Bình, but those are clearly not relevant since they're not in the new \"Tỉnh Tây Ninh.\"\n\nThen, I landed on **1682/NQ-UBTVQH15**, which is *specifically* about Tây Ninh. Line 46 in that resolution is key: it details that \"Mỹ Lộc\" (along with \"Phước Lâm\" and \"Thuận Thành\") was re-formed into a new \"Xã Mỹ Lộc\" within the new province, Tây Ninh. Although this resolution doesn't explicitly link \"Mỹ Lộc\" with \"Huyện Cần Giuộc\" in context, the fact that the resolution is for Tây Ninh is a strong indicator.\n\nFurthermore, line 47 mentions \"Cần Giuộc\", which was the district from the original user's request. Since the old address was \"Xã Mỹ Lộc, Huyện Cần Giuộc, Tỉnh Long An\", this is now the new administrative unit for this area. Based on this, it's highly probable the new administrative unit is a new \"**Xã Mỹ Lộc**\" within \"Tây Ninh.\" The change involved a merger with \"Phước Lâm\" and \"Thuận Thành.\" That's the best answer I can provide, given the context.\n",

My first instinct is to work backward, systematically analyzing the provided resolutions and known changes.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the initial scope of the changes.  The old province is \\\"Tỉnh Long An\\\", so I'll begin by focusing on resolutions impacting that province.  A quick review reveals Resolution 18 (likely referring to Resolution 60-NQ/TW) highlights a merger.  Specifically, it indicates that \\\"Tỉnh Long An\\\" merged into \\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\" to become \\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh.\\\" That's the fundamental shift to keep in mind.\\n\\nNow, I'll meticulously go through the list of resolutions provided, focusing on any mentions of \\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc\\\" or \\\"Huyện Cần Giuộc\\\" within the context of either the original \\\"Long An\\\" or the resulting \\\"Tây Ninh\\\".  I can safely disregard any resolutions related to provinces other than Tây Ninh, as they won't be relevant.  The documents that cover: Hà Nội, Đà Nẵng, Gia Lai, Hà Tĩnh, Hưng Yên, Khánh Hòa, Ninh Bình, and Quảng Trị are all irrelevant.\\n\\nFinally, I land on 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15, a resolution concerning Tây Ninh. This is where things get interesting.  Line 46 mentions \\\"xã Mỹ Lộc,\\\" specifically formed from \\\"Phước Lâm, Thuận Thành, and Mỹ Lộc.\\\" It's tempting to jump to conclusions, however, it's crucial to acknowledge the ambiguity here.  While this resolution undoubtedly affects Tây Ninh, the text doesn't explicitly confirm whether this particular \\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\" includes or replaces the \\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc, Long An\\\" I'm investigating. The wording could refer to a preexisting Mỹ Lộc within Tây Ninh.\\n\\nLine 47 mentions \\\"thị trấn Cần Giuộc\\\", and creates \\\"xã Cần Giuộc.\\\" This part is not relevant to our old address.\\n\\nUltimately, based on the provided information, I can confidently state that \\\"Tỉnh Long An\\\" no longer exists; it's now part of \\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh.\\\" However, I *cannot* definitively state whether the \\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc\\\" in the original address is incorporated into the new \\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\" created by Resolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15. Further investigation is necessary to clarify the precise geographical boundaries of this new \\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\".\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\",\n        \"line\": \"18.

First things first: I know \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Long An\\\\\\\" is the old province.  Now I need to check the resolutions to see if anything has changed.\\\\n\\\\nI quickly check Resolution 18 (60-NQ/TW) and see that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Long An\\\\\\\" merged with \\\\\\\"Tây Ninh\\\\\\\", becoming \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\".  That's my starting point. Now I have to go through the other resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nI've already scanned the irrelevant resolutions (1656, 1659, 1664, 1665, 1666, 1667, 1674, 1680) and found nothing that helps. The resolutions seem to have \\\\\\\"Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" in various provinces, but none of them are in the context of Long An.\\\\n\\\\nResolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tây Ninh) is my target. This one's important because it's for the new province, Tây Ninh.  I examine it carefully. Line 46 states \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Phước Lâm, Thuận Thành và Mỹ Lộc thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Mỹ Lộc**.\\\\\\\"  It mentions \\\\\\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" - a perfect match to the original address. However, the resolution specifically states that this new \\\\\\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" is formed from merging \\\\\\\"Phước Lâm, Thuận Thành, and Mỹ Lộc.\\\\\\\" It is possible that the old \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" from Long An is now this \\\\\\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" because of the merger of Long An into Tây Ninh, but the resolutions don't specify the original province for the communes. The resolution shows that \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\", at least in name.\\\\n\\\\nLine 47 mentions a new \\\\\\\"xã Cần Giuộc\\\\\\\" being formed from \\\\\\\"thị trấn Cần Giuộc\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"xã Phước Lại\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"xã Long Hậu\\\\\\\".  This resolution seems to show that \\\\\\\"Huyện Cần Giuộc\\\\\\\" has become a \\\\\\\"xã Cần Giuộc\\\\\\\", but this resolution is in context of Tây Ninh.\\\\n\\\\nEssentially, I need more information to definitively determine whether the old \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" is precisely the new \\\\\\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" described in Resolution 1682. The resolution does suggest the new \\\\\\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" still retains the name \\\\\\\"xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\". So, based on this initial analysis, it appears that the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" might still be \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" within the context of the new \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\", but I'd need confirmation that the \\\\\\\"Mỹ Lộc\\\\\\\" mentioned is *this* Mỹ Lộc. Also, I'm unsure of the fate of \\\\\\\"Huyện Cần Giuộc\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"18.
