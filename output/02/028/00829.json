  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, let me break this down. The user wants me to map an old administrative unit to its new counterpart based on some provided resolutions. I need to take the old ward, `Xã Sủng Tráng, Huyện Yên Minh, Tỉnh Hà Giang`, and figure out where it belongs now.\n\nFirst, I see that resolution `60-NQ/TW` is key. It details province mergers. `Tỉnh Hà Giang` isn't on the list of non-merged provinces, and it lists a merge of `Tỉnh Hà Giang` with `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang` to create `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`.  So, that's straightforward: the province is now `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`. High confidence on that one.\n\nNext, I need to figure out the new ward.  Resolution `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15` about Quảng Trị is irrelevant, so I can ignore that. But `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15` is about Tuyên Quang, which is now relevant because Hà Giang merged into it. This resolution concerns the reorganization of the old `Huyện Yên Minh`, which is promising since my input ward is also in that district. The resolution details merging several wards and the former Yên Minh town into a new ward called `Xã Yên Minh`.\n\nHere's the problem: my input ward, `Xã Sủng Tráng`, isn't explicitly listed as being part of that merger. The resolution only gives a partial list of the wards that form the new `Xã Yên Minh`. However, because the user explicitly states that all districts are eliminated, and because my ward is from the same district as the merging wards, I have to assume my ward got merged, too. It's just not clear *where* specifically.\n\nMy best guess is that `Xã Sủng Tráng` is now part of the new `Xã Yên Minh`, because it is also in the same old district. But since the text only details a *partial* list of wards that formed this new unit and doesn't explicitly mention `Xã Sủng Tráng`, my confidence level in this is low. It's possible the ward merged somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, I'll structure the JSON output as follows. The province is now `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`, and the most likely candidate for the new ward is `Xã Yên Minh` with the code `00820`. My confidence level will be set to \"low\" because of the lack of explicit confirmation in the text. I'll cite `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15` for the ward mapping. I'll put all of this information into a single JSON object in an array.\n",

Let's break it down. First, the old \\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\" is now part of \\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\" – that's a straightforward province-level change and easy to confirm.  The user mentioned all the old districts have been eliminated so \\\"Huyện Yên Minh\\\" is gone too.  That means I need to focus on ward-level changes within Tuyên Quang.\\n\\nNow, the trick is finding out what happened to \\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\". Resolution `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Tuyên Quang looks promising.  Line 57 mentions a new \\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\" being formed from several other units in the former district. However, \\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\" itself isn't *directly* mentioned in the list of merged wards in that line. That's a bit of a wrinkle. I'm inferring here.\\n\\nGiven that the entire district was dissolved and a new \\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\" emerged, it's highly likely that \\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\" was incorporated into this new \\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\", even if it isn't specifically named. The new list of wards includes the ward \\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\" and a corresponding ward code, which lends further support to the theory.\\n\\nSo, I'm confident about \\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\" and I can reasonably assume \\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\" is the new ward for \\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\", *but* because I'm not seeing that explicit mention of \\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\" in the documents, I have to lower the confidence to \\\"low\\\".  I'll need to cite the appropriate resolution and line and caveat my findings.  The final JSON output needs to reflect that nuanced understanding. The user will need this important information.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tuyên Quang\",\n        \"line\": \"57.

This is a bit of a puzzle, but a fun one! The user is throwing a few resolutions at me (`60-NQ/TW`, `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15`, `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`), and a list of new wards with their details. My task? Figure out the new administrative unit(s) and present them in a neat JSON array.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I break down the request. The user needs the updated address. The context includes provincial mergers (resolution `60-NQ/TW`) and ward-level changes. It's crucial to identify if `Sủng Tráng` is mentioned in those resolutions and, if not, to list all possible new wards with `low` confidence where appropriate.\\\\n\\\\nI start by taking a close look at the input address: It's in `Hà Giang` province, `Yên Minh` district, and specifically `Sủng Tráng` ward.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let's dive into these resolutions! The first one, `60-NQ/TW`, is a game-changer. It explains that `Hà Giang` province merged with `Tuyên Quang`, effectively becoming `Tuyên Quang`. Bingo! The new province will definitely be `Tuyên Quang`.\\\\n\\\\nThe second resolution, `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15`, doesn't look relevant; it's about Quang Tri province, not my target region. I can quickly dismiss it.\\\\n\\\\nThe third, `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`, is promising. It deals with `Tuyên Quang`, which is now relevant because of the merger. I'm especially interested in the section concerning Yên Minh district. This resolution states that several wards are restructuring into a new `Xã Yên Minh`. However, my ward, `Xã Sủng Tráng`, isn't explicitly listed in the merging wards. But this restructuring is comprehensive, and it's extremely probable that Sủng Tráng, being part of Yen Minh district, was affected, even if not explicitly stated in this single line.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, I move to the \\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\" list. I have to search for potential matches, knowing that the province is now `Tuyên Quang`. Most of the entries are irrelevant, being in the wrong province. However, I spot one that's a very strong candidate: `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"00820\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\"}`. The province is correct (due to the merger), and the name of the new ward is `Yên Minh`, just like the district.\\\\n\\\\n**Conclusion:**\\\\n\\\\nBased on the information, the old ward, `Xã Sủng Tráng, Huyện Yên Minh, Tỉnh Hà Giang` has likely changed to `Xã Yên Minh, Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`. Although not explicitly confirmed in resolution `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`, this is the most logical conclusion given the major restructuring within Yen Minh district and the provincial merger. I will label this with a `low` confidence to reflect this ambiguity.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"57.

My goal is to map the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng, Huyện Yên Minh, Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to its new administrative unit. First, I identified that the province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged with another, so I need to check the relevant province-level resolutions. Based on resolution 60-NQ/TW, Hà Giang is now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I zeroed in on the district and ward levels: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" respectively.  I then investigated the key resolution concerning administrative restructuring in Tuyên Quang: 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15. This resolution is crucial. It details the merging of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and several communes, including \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lao Và Chải, Hữu Vinh, Đông Minh, Vần Chải,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into a new ward called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* explicitly mentioned in this resolution.  The resolution is specific; it lists the *exact* units contributing to the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  While the old district \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is referenced, the resolution only addresses the merger of the town and those specific communes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, looking at the available new ward data for Tuyên Quang, I see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward_code: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"00820\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). Logically, since it contains the district name, this is relevant. But the key is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sủng Tráng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned as part of it.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, because resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 only lists a *subset* of Yên Minh's old units merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sủng Tráng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't among them, I lack definitive evidence. It's possible \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sủng Tráng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but wasn't explicitly listed, it was merged elsewhere, or it remained unchanged. The resolution is simply not clear on its fate. I have no evidence of a direct merger.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, my confidence level for this mapping is low. The best I can say is that the province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the related ward (if any) is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with code \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"00820,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but this isn't a confident mapping, based on the citations provided.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Tuyên Quang và tỉnh Hà Giang, lấy tên là tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"00820\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"57.

The user's given me \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng, Huyện Yên Minh, Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and wants a mapping to the new units. Straightforward, right? Well, not quite.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and, per resolution 60-NQ/TW, noted its merger into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" So far, so good. Then I pinpointed the specific district and ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I looked at resolutions pertinent to Tuyên Quang. Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 popped up, and it dealt with the reorganization of communes.  I noticed it mentioned \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" – specifically, the *town* of Yên Minh and some *specific* communes being merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Crucially, though, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wasn't listed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy expert intuition, sharpened by years in this field, told me to carefully re-read the resolution. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số củathị trấn Yên Minh vàcác xã Lao Và Chải, Hữu Vinh, Đông Minh, Vần Chảithành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" – it was about *those* units, *not* all of Huyện Yên Minh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe fact that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is conspicuously *absent* from this list is the key. While the district name is mentioned, the resolution only details which units are *specifically* being merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Since \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't included, there's a strong chance it wasn't part of this merger. The data confirms this; only \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is available in the new wards.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, although \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is related to the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" district, the confidence level must be low. We don't have explicit evidence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sủng Tráng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"'s fate. It *could* be part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but the absence of it from the explicit list makes me hesitant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUltimately, my JSON output reflects this uncertainty:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `province_name`: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (due to the province merger)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `ward_name`: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (because it's the only relevant new ward)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `ward_code`: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"00820\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `confidence`: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   Citation should include 60-NQ/TW regarding province merger and 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 with relevant lines.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis is the most cautious and accurate mapping I can provide given the information available.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Tuyên Quang và tỉnh Hà Giang, lấy tên là tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"00820\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"57.
