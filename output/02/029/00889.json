  "thought": "**Analyzing the Reorganization of \"Xã Thanh Vân\"**\n\nOkay, so the user wants to identify the new administrative unit for \"Xã Thanh Vân, Huyện Quản Bạ, Tỉnh Hà Giang\" based on these resolutions. The first thing I need to do is account for the provincial merger. I remember from resolution \"60-NQ/TW\" that Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang merged into \"Tuyên Quang\". That's a key piece of information.\n\nNext, I'll systematically search through the provided resolutions for mentions of either \"Xã Thanh Vân\" or \"Huyện Quản Bạ\". I'll be looking for any hints on how this particular ward was restructured. I quickly ruled out the irrelevant resolutions, and, as expected, it was in \"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15\" that I found my answer. This resolution specifically concerns Tuyên Quang province.\n\nLine 63 of \"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15\" is the key. It clearly states that \"Xã Thanh Vân\" and \"Xã Nghĩa Thuận\" are merged into a new \"Xã Nghĩa Thuận\". That's very straightforward. Additionally, line 64 of this same resolution mentions \"Xã Quản Bạ\" which is significant because our old \"Xã Thanh Vân\" was located in \"Huyện Quản Bạ\". Since the user explicitly stated to eliminate all districts, this means that the mention of \"Quản Bạ\" in this line is referring to the old *xã* named \"Quản Bạ\", not the *huyện* (district). The district \"Quản Bạ\" itself, no longer exists as an administrative unit.\n\nSo, it's pretty clear: the new ward is \"Xã Nghĩa Thuận\". Now, I'll need to confirm this by looking up the `ward_code` and making sure the `province_name` is correct in the provided \"New wards\" list.\n\nI searched the \"New wards\" data and found a perfect match: `{\"ward_code\":\"00889\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Nghĩa Thuận\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\"}`. The province name is now \"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\", which is consistent with the province merger I found at the beginning.\n\nThe mapping is very clear and direct from the resolution, so the confidence level is high. The final answer is: New Ward: \"Xã Nghĩa Thuận\" (ward_code: 00889) in \"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\". And, for good measure, the citation is line 63 of \"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15.\"\n",
