  "thought": "**Identifying the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Xuân Giang, Huyện Quang Bình, Tỉnh Hà Giang\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \"Xã Xuân Giang, Huyện Quang Bình, Tỉnh Hà Giang\" and I need to figure out what the new administrative unit is.  My first instinct is to break it down. \"Tỉnh Hà Giang\" is the province, \"Huyện Quang Bình\" is the district, and \"Xã Xuân Giang\" is the ward.  I know that Hà Giang merged with Tuyên Quang, so the province is now Tuyên Quang. That's a key piece of information.\n\nMy next step is to examine the resolutions and new wards data.  I'm going through them methodically.  I checked resolutions about province mergers (60-NQ/TW) and found the information that Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang merged into Tuyên Quang. Then, I dug into \"Other resolutions\".  I'm looking for \"Xã Xuân Giang\" but I have to consider that it could be in Tuyên Quang now.  There were mentions of \"Xã Xuân Giang\" in resolutions for Hà Nội, Hà Tĩnh, and Ninh Bình, but those are irrelevant. Then I hit 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tuyên Quang), which is the most promising.\n\nThis resolution is interesting. It mentions rearranging \"Xã Xuân Giang\" by merging it with \"Xã Nà Khương\" to form a *new* \"Xã Xuân Giang\".  The problem is, the resolution doesn't definitively say whether this \"Xã Xuân Giang\" is the one from the *old* Hà Giang or if it already existed in Tuyên Quang before the merge.  Given that it mentions \"Xã Nà Khương\", and the resolution's context of rearranging Tuyên Quang's administrative units, it's *possible* it's the same \"Xã Xuân Giang\", however, given the context of the resolution, the units are said to have already been within the scope of Tuyên Quang, at the time of the resolution.\n\nThe resolution, however, does say that the *new* administrative unit is still called \"Xã Xuân Giang\". So, while there is ambiguity about *which* \"Xã Xuân Giang\" is referred to in the resolution, the name itself remains the same.  This needs further investigation to confirm the new district.\n",
