  "thought": "**Mapping Analysis for Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a task: pinpoint the likely new administrative location for \"Xã Sán Xả Hồ, Huyện Hoàng Su Phì, Tỉnh Hà Giang,\" given these resolutions.  I'll break this down methodically.\n\nFirst, I looked at the province level. Resolution `60-NQ/TW` is clear: Hà Giang is absorbed into Tuyên Quang. That's straightforward.  So, we're now dealing with \"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\"\n\nNext, I have to figure out the ward level, looking at the commune-level resolution `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  The old ward is \"Xã Sán Xả Hồ,\" part of the former \"Huyện Hoàng Su Phì,\" which according to the prompt I'm eliminating. However, the resolution doesn't mention \"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\" at all!  It details the formation of \"Xã Tân Tiến\" and \"Xã Hoàng Su Phì\" from specific component wards. No luck there.\n\nI've got to be meticulous here. The task is to identify *possible* new units containing the old one, right? And I have to *only* use the provided information.\n\nAlright. I know that the old province is now part of \"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\". And I know that \"Huyện Hoàng Su Phì\" is being eliminated. Two new communes are named \"Xã Hoàng Su Phì\" and \"Xã Tân Tiến\". But *crucially*, \"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\" isn't listed as a component of either of those new communes in the text of the resolution. If it's not mentioned, I can't guess!  There's no basis for thinking it *could* be one of the suggested new wards. Maybe it was absorbed into another new ward (or some other change took place not described in this text), but I don't know that. I'm limited to the provided information.\n\nBased on the explicit wording of the instruction to *only* consider the provided information and the lack of mention of \"Xã Sán Xả Hồ,\" I have to conclude that a definitive mapping can't be made. My confidence is low because I don't have enough to work with.\n\nTherefore, the only honest answer, as per the rules of the task, is an empty list, because I can't identify a viable match from the information given. I must return `[]`.\n",

I have some resolutions and a list of new wards to work with.\\n\\nFirst, I need to analyze the input. I see the old ward, the resolutions (`60-NQ/TW` and `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`), and the new wards list. My goal is to use the resolutions to trace the evolution of `Xã Sán Xả Hồ`.\\n\\n*   I start with the province. `Tỉnh Hà Giang` is the old province. Resolution `60-NQ/TW` indicates the merging of provinces. I find that `Tỉnh Hà Giang` merged with `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang` to form, well, `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`. So, I know the new province for `Xã Sán Xả Hồ` is `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`.\\n\\n*   Now, the trickier part: the district and ward. The old district is `Huyện Hoàng Su Phì`, and the old ward is `Xã Sán Xả Hồ`. The user says all districts are eliminated, which means I need to look for mergers. Resolution `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15` seems relevant since it focuses on the restructuring of communes in `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`. I read through it carefully, line by line.\\n\\n    *   I spot a couple of potential clues: one line mentions the merger of `xã Tân Tiến`, `Bản Nhùng`, and `Túng Sán` into a new `xã Tân Tiến`. This involves `Huyện Hoàng Su Phì`, but `Xã Sán Xả Hồ` isn't mentioned.\\n    *   Another line details the merger of `thị trấn Vinh Quang`, `xã Bản Luốc`, `Ngàm Đăng Vài`, `Tụ Nhân`, and `Đản Ván` into a new `xã Hoàng Su Phì`. Again, it implicitly involves `Huyện Hoàng Su Phì`, but not `Xã Sán Xả Hồ`.\\n\\n*   Synthesizing this, I have a few things: I know the new province is `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`, and I know the old ward was in `Huyện Hoàng Su Phì`. I can see the new wards list which contains `Xã Hoàng Su Phì` and `Xã Tân Tiến` within `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`. However, the resolutions I was given only provide information about a handful of administrative rearrangements. `Xã Sán Xả Hồ` is not mentioned in either.\\n\\n*   This poses a problem. I cannot find any match for `Xã Sán Xả Hồ`. The information given is insufficient to definitively map the old ward to a new one with any confidence. I'd need more complete data or different resolutions to make a reliable determination. Consequently, I must respond that I cannot find a new ward for `Xã Sán Xả Hồ`.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ, Huyện Hoàng Su Phì, Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 14705,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0028867999999999997,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, I've got a request to map an old administrative unit, specifically `Xã Sán Xả Hồ, Huyện Hoàng Su Phì, Tỉnh Hà Giang`, to a new one, based on the provided resolutions. This is a common task after these administrative restructuring efforts, and it's something I'm well-versed in.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to break down the information I have. I see the old ward details, the resolutions (`60-NQ/TW` and `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`), and a list of new wards.  My initial instinct is to work from the top down, analyzing each piece of information to understand the changes.\\\\n\\\\nThe province mapping is straightforward. `60-NQ/TW` clearly states the merger of Hà Giang and Tuyên Quang into a single province, Tuyên Quang. So, I know the new province for `Xã Sán Xả Hồ` will be Tuyên Quang. That's step one, a pretty simple case.\\\\n\\\\nNow, for the tricky part: the ward level. I immediately recognize the challenge.  `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15` is the resolution for the merger of communes within Tuyên Quang, so it is the most relevant resolution.  My strategy is to meticulously go through the lines of `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`, looking for any mention of `Xã Sán Xả Hồ` or `Huyện Hoàng Su Phì`.\\\\n\\\\nI carefully read through the text, and I identify a few key merger lines: one merging `Tân Tiến`, `Bản Nhùng`, and `Túng Sán` into a new `Xã Tân Tiến`.  The second line covers the merging of `Vinh Quang`, `Bản Luốc`, `Ngàm Đăng Vài`, `Tụ Nhân`, and `Đản Ván` to a new `Xã Hoàng Su Phì`.  Both are relevant because they deal with units from `Huyện Hoàng Su Phì`.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, after a thorough review, I find that `Xã Sán Xả Hồ` isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the relevant lines. This is where my expertise comes into play. I'm trained to consider all scenarios, and understand what the documents mean. The problem statement says that wards are either merged, split, or remain unchanged. Given the massive restructuring implied by the resolutions, the probability that `Xã Sán Xả Hồ` kept the same name is very low.\\\\n\\\\nI carefully weigh all evidence, and the most likely case is that `Xã Sán Xả Hồ` was merged into a new ward. The provided resolution does not specify where it was merged. Thus, I am unable to confidently map it to any of the new wards listed. I have to admit that the information provided is insufficient for a definitive answer. I cannot map this ward.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ, Huyện Hoàng Su Phì, Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 18855,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.003971799999999999,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Address Mapping Analysis: Vietnamese Address Transformation**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with an address mapping task involving a change in administrative boundaries in Vietnam. My initial thought process needs to deconstruct the old address:  `Xã Sán Xả Hồ, Huyện Hoàng Su Phì, Tỉnh Hà Giang` and map it to a new address.  I'm armed with two key resolutions to guide me: 60-NQ/TW and 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the impact of Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This one's straightforward: it clearly states that the old province of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of the new province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  So, any new address will be in Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I delve into Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15.  This is where the real work begins.  My initial focus is on whether \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are directly mentioned. Line 95 mentions `Hoàng Su Phì` implicitly by creating the new `Xã Tân Tiến` from `Tân Tiến`, `Bản Nhùng`, and `Túng Sán`.  Line 96 mentions `Hoàng Su Phì` again and it merges `Vinh Quang`, `Bản Luốc`, `Ngàm Đăng Vài`, `Tụ Nhân`, and `Đản Ván` into `Xã Hoàng Su Phì`.  Critically, `Sán Xả Hồ` is *not* explicitly included in either of these merging processes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI then check my list of new wards: `Xã Hoàng Su Phì`, `Xã Tân Tiến`, and `Xã Yên Hoa` in `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`.  Seeing the resolutions, I immediately grasp that my information is limited. The merging processes are focused, and don't describe the full map of ward transformations.  It's clear that the resolutions don't tell the *whole* story.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the information, I can only determine the mapping from `Tỉnh Hà Giang` to `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`. I know \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is mentioned by name in lines 95 and 96, where new wards were created.  But, I cannot confirm how `Sán Xả Hồ` was reorganized. Since it *was* in `Hoàng Su Phì`, it *could* be now part of `Hoàng Su Phì` or `Tân Tiến`, or a completely new ward, or still using its old name. The latter is unlikely as I have no evidence of a ward in my list of candidates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the incompleteness, my best course of action is to offer the two wards formed from `Hoàng Su Phì`:  `Xã Hoàng Su Phì` and `Xã Tân Tiến` as candidates. However, I must note a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" confidence level because `Sán Xả Hồ` is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.  For each, I need to create a citation that properly references the lines from 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 that describe their creation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis process seems sufficient for my needs. The output will be a JSON array of possible options with the necessary confidence levels and citations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"96.

I'll need to work systematically through the available data to do this accurately.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the components of the old address. Now, the main challenge is the province change indicated in the resolutions. It looks like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as per the Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW). That's straightforward: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the new province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I reviewed Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other Resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I'm looking for clues about the old ward or district. The resolution *does* mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the old district). I see that specific *communes* within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" have been merged to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Tiến\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Crucially, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" itself isn't *explicitly* mentioned in these mergers.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI also checked the list of new wards that have been created. I have codes and names for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Tiến\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Yên Hoa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" These give me some potential options but I need to link the older commune.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem: I have no direct evidence of what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Since the old ward isn't in these listed mergers, I can't definitively map it to either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Tiến\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I understand from the user guidelines \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Most of the wards have been renamed / split or merged. A small number of the wards are kept unchanged.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I can only say with confidence that the new province is Tỉnh Tuyên Quang, due to resolution 60-NQ/TW.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI'm constrained by the information available: I know the district is mentioned, but the given resolution only lists specific communes that are merged. So, I must have a *low* confidence level on any specific ward mapping. However, the user needs me to provide possible candidates so I'll suggest that since the old district is mentioned, and the prompt states the need to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"include all possible new ward candidates based on the provided contents.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I will include \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Tiến\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but make sure that the confidence is low.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1.

The challenge is that these units have undergone some transformations, requiring me to consult resolutions and available data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I had to identify the address components: the old ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), the district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), and the province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I delved into the province resolutions (60-NQ/TW).  I quickly realized that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hà Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" So, the new province is definitely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That was the easy part.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen came the real work: dissecting the other resolutions, particularly 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15. I focused on locating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the text. While I found mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the formation of new wards like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Tiến\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Su Phì,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" itself wasn't directly referenced in the extracts provided.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI also checked the data on new wards, looking for any clear match with the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but didn't find one. The resolutions only list specific communes that are merged, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't among them. This leads me to believe that either it was not merged, or the details of its merge, if any, aren't present in the information I have.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGiven the instructions and the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" caveat, I'm facing a dilemma. While I know that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is mentioned, and the prompt asks for *all possible* new candidates, I can't definitively determine the exact new ward for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sán Xả Hồ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on this limited information. However, since the prompt specifies that I must include *all possible* candidates, and the prompt specifies the old district as part of the address, I might consider \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Tiến\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Su Phì\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as possible candidates. But, my confidence is inherently low.
