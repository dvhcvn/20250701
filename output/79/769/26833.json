  "thought": "**My Thought Process: Mapping Old Wards to New Ones**\n\nOkay, so I've got a request to figure out which new wards replaced the old ward, \"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ,\" in Hồ Chí Minh City, based on the provided resolutions. I need to generate a JSON array with the answers, including citations and confidence levels. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I analyze the input: \"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\" from \"Thành phố Thủ Đức,\" within \"Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh.\"  I know \"Thành phố Thủ Đức\" is now an old administrative unit, so that's key. I need to use the resolutions to determine the current ward names.\n\nI start by checking the province resolutions (60-NQ/TW). Fortunately, it confirms that \"Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh\" is still the correct province name, which makes things easier.\n\nNext, I dive into the other resolution (1685/NQ-UBTVQH15). I need to specifically look for \"Long Thạnh Mỹ\" within the text.  Bingo! Line 71 clearly states that *part* of \"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\" merged into the new \"Phường Tăng Nhơn Phú.\"  This is a direct hit, so I'll create a JSON object for that.  Then, line 72 says the *remaining* part of \"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\" went into \"Phường Long Bình.\" Another direct hit!  That means I'll need a second JSON object.\n\nNow, I cross-reference the new ward list.  For \"Phường Tăng Nhơn Phú,\" I find a perfect match.  Likewise, \"Phường Long Bình\" is also a direct match in the new ward list.  Wonderful!\n\nFinally, I construct the JSON output:  It'll be an array containing two objects, one for each new ward.  Each object will include the citation from the resolutions, which is \"1685/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh,\" plus the relevant line number, and of course, information from the new ward list (ward code, ward name, province name).  The first JSON object will indicate that \"a portion of\"  \"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\" was merged into \"Phường Tăng Nhơn Phú\". The second one indicates that \"the rest of\" \"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\" went into \"Phường Long Bình\".  The confidence level for both will be very high because the resolution lines directly state this re-mapping. All set!\n",

I see \\\"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\" (the old ward), \\\"Thành phố Thủ Đức\\\" (which is now defunct), and \\\"Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh\\\" (the province). No surprises on the province front; it still stands. I'll need to double-check that with any relevant resolutions.\\n\\nNext, I look for province-level changes. Aha! Resolution 60-NQ/TW doesn't impact the province name, so \\\"Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh\\\" is still valid. Good. Now, the real meat of the problem lies in the ward-level changes within Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh. Resolution 1685/NQ-UBTVQH15 is the key document here.\\n\\nI dive into that resolution, line by line, hunting for \\\"Long Thạnh Mỹ.\\\" Bingo!

Now, onto the main task: pinpointing the new ward(s) for \\\\\\\"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nI'm looking at Resolution 1685/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key document here.  I zeroed in on the lines mentioning \\\\\\\"Long Thạnh Mỹ.\\\\\\\"  Crucially, Line 71 states that *part* of \\\\\\\"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\" went into a new ward called \\\\\\\"Tăng Nhơn Phú.\\\\\\\"  Then, Line 72 clarifies that the *remaining part* of \\\\\\\"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\" (after the previous split) was merged into \\\\\\\"Long Bình.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis is the critical realization:  \\\\\\\"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\" has been split.  Some of it went to \\\\\\\"Tăng Nhơn Phú,\\\\\\\" and the rest to \\\\\\\"Long Bình.\\\\\\\"  Since the original address doesn't specify *which part*, I have to acknowledge uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\nI found the codes for the new wards: \\\\\\\"Tăng Nhơn Phú\\\\\\\" has code \\\\\\\"26842,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Long Bình\\\\\\\" has code \\\\\\\"26833\\\\\\\".

The user's given me the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ, Thành phố Thủ Đức, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and wants to know its new ward. My first step is to delve into the relevant resolutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I quickly confirm that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged as the province, thanks to Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This is straightforward but essential context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I zero in on Resolution 1685/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key document for ward restructuring. I'm looking specifically for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the text. Lines 71 and 72 jump out immediately. Line 71 clearly states that *a portion* of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is being absorbed into the new ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tăng Nhơn Phú.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Line 72 then tells me that *the remainder* of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (after the split) will become part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Long Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the identification: I need the codes for these new wards.  From the provided new ward data, I can pull the necessary information: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tăng Nhơn Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has code \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"26842,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Long Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has code \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"26833.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Easy enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the tricky part: confidence. Because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *split* between two new wards, I can't definitively assign the *entire* old address to a single new ward. It's impossible to pinpoint which part of the old ward maps to which of the new wards without more granular information (like a specific street or house number). This means my confidence level *must* be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I can only provide the possible new wards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, when constructing the JSON output, I'll provide *both* potential mappings. Each will cite Resolution 1685/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically referencing lines 71 and 72, which directly address the split of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Long Thạnh Mỹ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The province will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" drawn from both the province resolution and the new ward data. The key element is that each entry will have a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" since the original ward was split and no specific location is provided.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn conclusion, the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Long Thạnh Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" now potentially includes parts of both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Tăng Nhơn Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (code 26842) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Long Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (code 26833), with a low degree of confidence. This reflects the uncertainty inherent in the original address's lack of specificity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1685/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"71.
