My first thought is, this requires a systematic approach. I need to account for potential province mergers and ward re-organizations.\n\n**Step 1: Province Merger:**  The provided information on province mergers clearly states that \"Tỉnh Bình Định\" was merged into \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\".  This means I'm now looking at \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\". This is a crucial first piece of the puzzle.  High confidence here, as it's a direct and unambiguous fact from the provided document.\n\n**Step 2: Ward Re-organization:** Now, the more difficult part. I've got to sift through those resolutions, specifically focusing on \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\".  Initially, I was hoping for a straightforward mention of \"Xã Vĩnh Quang\" being *merged into* a new or existing ward, but after careful review of the relevant resolution (1664/NQ-UBTVQH15 concerning Gia Lai), it appears \"Xã Vĩnh Quang\" is *not* explicitly mentioned. There is a mention of \"Vĩnh Thạnh\" being re-organized, but not including \"Vĩnh Quang\".\n\n**Determining Confidence:**  This is where things get tricky.  The fact that \"Xã Vĩnh Quang\" isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the resolutions, *especially* the one dealing with \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\", is a significant indicator of missing information. Without a clear directive on how \"Xã Vĩnh Quang\" was re-organized or merged, my confidence is quite low.  There are a couple of possibilities: either the records are incomplete, the reorganization was handled through a different resolution, or the ward itself might not have changed, although the province change affects its official identity. I need more data to be certain.\n",
