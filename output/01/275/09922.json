  "thought": "**Analyzing the Ward Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to map an old administrative unit, \"Xã Phú Cát, Huyện Quốc Oai, Thành phố Hà Nội,\" to its new counterpart based on some provided resolutions. My thought process is as follows:\n\nFirst, I need to understand the request thoroughly. The core of the task is to pinpoint where \"Xã Phú Cát\" ended up after the administrative reshuffle. I've got to sift through these resolutions and identify if \"Xã Phú Cát\" is mentioned, figure out the new ward(s) that incorporate it (fully or partially), and then present the results in that specific JSON format. I also need to assess my confidence in the findings.\n\nNow, let's dive into the data. I see the old ward details: \"Xã Phú Cát, Huyện Quốc Oai, Thành phố Hà Nội\".  The resolution concerning Hà Nội, 60-NQ/TW, is mainly about provinces *not* changing. Good, that helps me stay focused. I'll need to go through the provided resolutions, looking for any mention of \"Phú Cát\" in Hà Nội province.\n\nThe key resolution is 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically for Hà Nội.  This is where things get interesting. Line 94 says a portion of \"Xã Phú Cát\" became part of a new \"Xã Hạ Bằng\".  That's a direct link! But wait, there's more. Line 101 then says \"the remaining part of Phú Cát commune\" is also being merged to the new \"Xã Phú Cát\".  So, \"Phú Cát\" didn't disappear completely, part of the old commune remains.\n\nSo it looks like I have two candidates: \"Xã Hạ Bằng\" and a new \"Xã Phú Cát.\" I can now check the provided \"New Wards Data\" JSON objects and their respective `ward_code` values to match them up.\n\n\"Xã Hạ Bằng\" matches \"09982\" - perfect! And the new \"Xã Phú Cát\" matches \"09952\" - I am noting that a trailing space exists in the name in that object.\n\nSo, synthesizing all of this: the old \"Xã Phú Cát\" was split. Part of it became \"Xã Hạ Bằng\" (code 09982), and the remaining part went to a new \"Xã Phú Cát\" (code 09952). The high confidence here stems from the explicit mentions within the resolution itself, specifically lines 94 and 101 of 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15. I will format the output as per the provided schema with this information.\n",

I quickly confirmed that Hanoi is one of the provinces *not* undergoing mergers, so Thành phố Hà Nội remains unchanged.  That's straightforward.\\n\\nThe real work lies in deciphering the ward and district changes. I zeroed in on Resolution 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one related to administrative reorganizations within Hanoi.  Analyzing this, lines 94 and 101 are key.  Line 94 indicates that *part* of the old \\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\" was incorporated into the new ward called \\\"Xã Hạ Bằng\\\". Then, line 101 states that the *remaining* portion of the old \\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\", along with other communes, formed a *new* \\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\".\\n\\nI skipped over the other resolutions because they weren't relevant to Hà Nội.  So, in conclusion, my analysis reveals that the old \\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\" has essentially been split.  Some of it went to \\\"Xã Hạ Bằng\\\", and the rest combined with other communes to form a *new* \\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\".  Therefore, the old address could correspond to either of these new wards, meaning both are potential matches. I need to be aware of this when providing the updated location.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1656/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Hà Nội\",\n        \"line\": \"94.

The user has given me the old address \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát, Huyện Quốc Oai, Thành phố Hà Nội\\\\\\\", and I need to figure out the new ward.  My approach will be methodical, starting with the highest-level information and drilling down.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the province is easy: it's \\\\\\\"Thành phố Hà Nội\\\\\\\". I know from my familiarity with the data that no significant province mergers happened, so that part of the address remains unchanged.\\\\n\\\\nNow for the tricky part: \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\".  I'm going to focus on resolutions that cover the Hanoi area, specifically *1656/NQ-UBTVQH15*, which deals with commune-level changes.  Scanning through the relevant sections, I find two key lines: line 94 and line 101.  These are the money lines.\\\\n\\\\nLine 94 tells me that *some* of the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\" is being combined with parts of other communes to form a *new* commune called \\\\\\\"Xã Hạ Bằng\\\\\\\".  Then, line 101 explains that the *remaining* part of the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\", after contributing to \\\\\\\"Hạ Bằng\\\\\\\", is merging with some other communes to form a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\".  Basically, the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\" is being split!\\\\n\\\\nSo, the new wards are clearly \\\\\\\"Xã Hạ Bằng\\\\\\\" and a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\". To confirm this, I cross-referenced these new wards against the \\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\" list. I found \\\\\\\"Xã Hạ Bằng\\\\\\\" with code \\\\\\\"09982\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\" with code \\\\\\\"09952\\\\\\\". I need to be careful with string matching to handle potential differences in spacing or capitalization (e.g., the extra space at the end of \\\\\\\"Phú Cát\\\\\\\" in the new ward data)\\\\n\\\\nHere's the problem: The original address is just \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\". Since the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\" has been *split*, I don't have enough information to say *definitively* which of these two new wards the original address corresponds to.  It depends on exactly where within the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\" the specific address is located.  Therefore, my confidence level in a specific answer will be *low*.  Both \\\\\\\"Xã Hạ Bằng\\\\\\\" and the *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\" are possibilities, but without more detail on the specific location within the old ward, a definitive answer is impossible.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1656/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Hà Nội\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"94.

The crucial resolution is `1656/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which details the restructuring of wards within Hà Nội.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking specifically at \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in that resolution, things get interesting.

I found both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hạ Bằng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", confirming my analysis. I also noticed the trailing space in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" name in the new wards list, which is important for matching purposes.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, and this is crucial, because the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been split, and the address provided is only \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cát,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I can't definitively say which new ward the user's address belongs to.
