  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Song Phượng, Huyện Đan Phượng, Thành phố Hà Nội\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down systematically. The user needs the new administrative designation for \"Xã Song Phượng, Huyện Đan Phượng, Thành phố Hà Nội\".  First, I've confirmed that the old ward is \"Xã Song Phượng\" and the old province is \"Thành phố Hà Nội\". Since Hà Nội isn't undergoing any province-level mergers (per Resolution 60-NQ/TW), the focus is on the ward level.\n\nNow, checking Resolution 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15, I found the situation became a bit complicated with potential matches and the need to double-check spellings.  Line 104 and 105 of that resolution suggested a town that sounded like the current user search (\"Song Phương\") might be split, with portions contributing to \"xã Sơn Đồng\" and \"xã An Khánh\". This implied that not all of the town would become part of a new ward.\n\nHowever, line 106 muddied the waters. That line listed a town also containing similar sounding name, and it stated it was contributing to a \"xã Đan Phượng\". The key detail there was that the text stated that *all* of the named ward, which could have been the town, was contributing to the newly named ward. This seemed to directly contradict the implication of the previous two lines.\n\nI then realized the critical difference here – a spelling variation! I needed to be careful about that.  The user's input is \"Xã Song **Phượng**\", while lines 104 and 105 dealt with \"Song **Phương**\".  Line 106, which mentioned the contributing town, *did* use the same spelling as the user input (\"Song **Phượng**\").\n\nTherefore, based on my analysis of the input and the provided resolution, and taking into account the spelling difference between \"Phương\" and \"Phượng\", my conclusion is that \"Xã Song Phượng\" is *entirely* subsumed into the newly formed \"xã Đan Phượng\" as stated in line 106 of 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15. The \"Song Phương\" described in lines 104 and 105 must be a different ward with a similar name, and that resolution can now be considered more completely.\n",
