  "thought": "**Identifying the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an old address: \"Xã Hương Sơn, Huyện Bình Xuyên, Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc.\" My task is to figure out the corresponding new administrative unit. First things first, I need to break down the information. \"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\" is clearly the old province. I'll check my knowledge base of province resolutions (60-NQ/TW, etc.). Ah, here we go, Vĩnh Phúc was merged into Phú Thọ to form a new province. So, the search shifts to the new province.\n\nNow I have to identify the specific ward, \"Xã Hương Sơn\". My approach is to meticulously search through relevant resolutions. I'll focus on those related to \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" or, to be thorough, I'll also check resolutions in which \"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\" is mentioned, as the original resolution might refer to the old names. I need to be careful, though, as other districts can also contain \"Hương Sơn.\"\n\nI've scanned through the resolutions, and I've found a promising lead: Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15. It explicitly mentions \"Xã Hương Sơn\" and \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\"! Excellent. The resolution says that \"Xã Hương Sơn\" was combined with other areas to form a new ward named \"xã Bình Xuyên\". This is precisely what I was looking for.\n\nI double-checked to make sure that there were no other relevant resolutions that would contradict this finding, but there weren't. Some of the resolutions did mention \"Hương Sơn\" but in contexts that were irrelevant. Given that I have confirmed the merger and the name of the new ward, I can confidently state that \"Xã Hương Sơn, Huyện Bình Xuyên, Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\" has been reorganized into \"Xã Bình Xuyên.\"\n",
