  "thought": "**Processing the Ward Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this ward mapping. I've got to take the user's input, map the old administrative unit (\"Xã Cao Phong, Huyện Sông Lô, Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\") to a new one, and present it in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I break down the user's information. I know the old ward, the relevant resolutions (especially `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Phú Thọ and the province merger resolution), a list of new wards, and the required output format.\n\nMy plan involves a step-by-step analysis. Starting with the old province, \"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\", I identify it now belongs to \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" based on resolution `60-NQ/TW`. That narrows my search to Phú Thọ's resolution, `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15`.\n\nNow, I'm digging into `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15`, looking for any mention of \"Xã Cao Phong\" and/or \"Huyện Sông Lô\". Here's where it gets interesting. I find a crucial line (line 67) stating that \"Xã Cao Phong\" is merged into \"Xã Sơn Đông\".  But, there's a catch: the district isn't specified in that line, which gives me pause. And then, line 91, says \"thị trấn Cao Phong\" is merged into a new \"Xã Cao Phong\". A name match but also a type mismatch!\n\nMy next step is to evaluate these potential candidates. My primary candidate, \"Xã Sơn Đông,\" is compelling due to the direct name match in the resolution.  However, the lack of district information from the resolution introduces uncertainty, and thus a low confidence.  My next candidate, \"Xã Cao Phong\", is similar: it has a name match but is also a low-confidence candidate because the resolution says \"thị trấn Cao Phong\" is part of the merge, which introduces a type mismatch.  I also look for \"Xã Sông Lô,\" but that isn't included in the merged ward descriptions.\n\nConsidering the input data, and the nature of these merging processes, I'm going to include both of these results.  In the final JSON, I will have an array with two JSON objects, each with a `province_name`, `ward_name`, `ward_code`, `confidence`, and `citation`. I will be sure to label both with \"low\" confidence and include the corresponding line of the resolution for context. I think this gives the user a complete picture, even with the inherent ambiguities.\n\nI double-check everything: province mapping, the right resolution, and that I'm considering the edge cases and ambiguities with the merging data. It's a bit of a puzzle, but with the data available, I feel confident this is the best possible analysis.\n",

First things first, I need to thoroughly understand the request and the data available.\\n\\n**1. Deconstructing the Request:**  I see the old ward is \\\"Xã Cao Phong, Huyện Sông Lô, Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\" and the task is to find its updated equivalent. The core of this is the provided resolutions: province mergers (like Resolution 60-NQ/TW), ward-level changes (specifically, resolutions 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Phú Thọ and 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Vĩnh Long), and a general list of new wards with their corresponding codes. The final output needs to be a JSON array formatted in a predefined schema.\\n\\n**2. Breaking Down the Old Unit:** My initial analysis reveals that \\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\" is the ward, \\\"Huyện Sông Lô\\\" is the district, and \\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\" is the province. This is my starting point.\\n\\n**3. Applying the Resolutions Systematically:** This is where the real work begins. I'll meticulously apply the information from the resolutions:\\n\\n**Step 3.1: Province Level Review (Resolution 60-NQ/TW):** The first step is to see if any province mergers or changes have occurred. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that \\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\" merged with \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\" and \\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\" to become \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\" So, the old province is now definitively \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\".\\n\\n**Step 3.2: Digging into Ward-Level Changes (Relevant Resolutions):** With the new province established as \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\\\" I now need to scrutinize Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, the resolution dealing with ward-level changes in this specific province. I'll read through the relevant lines, specifically looking for \\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\" or \\\"Huyện Sông Lô\\\".  Here's what I found:\\n*   Lines 58 and 59 refer to \\\"Huyện Sông Lô\\\" but don't mention \\\"Xã Cao Phong.\\\"\\n*   **Crucially, line 67 states: \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Tây Sơn, Cao Phong và Sơn Đông thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Sơn Đông**.\\\"** This is promising, as it *does* mention \\\"Cao Phong.\\\"  The context suggests \\\"Cao Phong\\\" here refers to the ward I am looking for.\\n*   Line 91: It mentions \\\"thị trấn Cao Phong, xã Hợp Phong và xã Thu Phong thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Cao Phong**.\\\" This line mentions \\\"Cao Phong\\\" specifically \\\"thị trấn Cao Phong\\\" and would be relevant if the initial request was about the town.\\n\\n**Conclusions:** Based on this analysis of Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, it seems that Xã Cao Phong is now part of the new Xã Sơn Đông.\\n\\nNow I need to formulate my response in the requested JSON format, and I'll be ready to provide the user with the correct mapping!\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1676/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Phú Thọ\",\n        \"line\": \"67.

This looks like a fun challenge.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to break down the user's input. They've given me \\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong, Huyện Sông Lô, Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\\\\\" and the task is to find its new location. I've got a laundry list of resolutions to work through, including province-level changes from 60-NQ/TW and ward/commune-level changes, like 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Phú Thọ and 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Vĩnh Long, plus a table of new ward codes and provinces to match the final output format.\\\\n\\\\nNow, let's analyze the input. \\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Lô\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\\\\\" is the province. Simple enough.\\\\n\\\\nStarting with the big picture, I'll check for province-level changes using 60-NQ/TW. This will tell me which modern province the old Vĩnh Phúc has become a part of. According to that document, Vĩnh Phúc, Phú Thọ, and Hòa Bình were merged into \\\\\\\"Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\" So, the old ward is now within the new province of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNext, I'll zero in on ward/commune changes within Phú Thọ using the relevant resolutions. 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 is the key here. Scanning the text, I'm looking for \\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\" or even \\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Lô\\\\\\\" to see where they've ended up.\\\\n\\\\nI'm now reading through 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, Phú Thọ's resolution for ward/commune reorganization. I see entries for merging and renaming units within \\\\\\\"huyện Sông Lô,\\\\\\\" but no exact matches. \\\\n\\\\nLine 67 looks promising: it mentions \\\\\\\"Cao Phong\\\\\\\" being merged into a new \\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông.\\\\\\\" However, the document doesn't explicitly state the district for that \\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\". Could this be the one? I must check if this is the relevant ward.\\\\n\\\\nSimilarly, line 91 suggests that \\\\\\\"thị trấn Cao Phong\\\\\\\" is merged into a new \\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\". It's a different type of unit, so it might add to confusion.\\\\n\\\\nIt seems I need further clarification on whether the Cao Phong that's being combined with Sơn Đông is the Cao Phong in Sông Lô, Vĩnh Phúc. The presence of the \\\\\\\"Xã\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Thị Trấn\\\\\\\" naming convention also might confuse the user.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1676/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"67.

The user's given me an old address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong, Huyện Sông Lô, Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  My task, as an expert in this, is to translate that into its modern equivalent.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I break down the old address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Lô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (province).  Now, I have to account for the changes due to resolutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI know that the old province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vĩnh Phúc,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged.  I quickly consult the provided resolutions, and I see that it's now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  That means \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is my new reference point.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the crucial step: I need to scrutinize the resolutions for changes affecting \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Lô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specifically, *within the context of Phú Thọ*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI zero in on Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I have to carefully analyze each relevant line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   I noticed lines 58 and 59 mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Sông Lô,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Sông Lô,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" respectively. My original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't directly mentioned there.\\\\\\\\n*   But I see in line 67, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Tây Sơn, Cao Phong và Sơn Đông thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Sơn Đông**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This line is important because it specifically mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cao Phong,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which is part of the old address.  I believe this to be a key lead.\\\\\\\\n*   Line 91 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của thị trấn Cao Phong, xã Hợp Phong và xã Thu Phong thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Cao Phong**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which means this one is for the thị trấn, not xã Cao Phong.\\\\\\\\n*   Line 134, refers to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Sông Lô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", created in line 59. This feels less relevant to my specific \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, where does that leave me? I've confirmed that the old province is now part of Phú Thọ.  Based on my analysis of the resolution and the original address, the most likely translation is **the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Sông Lô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the Tỉnh Phú Thọ.**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1676/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"91.

My initial thought process is to break it down and analyze each component. The first step is clear: I need to start with the province. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the starting point.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFortunately, I have access to resolutions, specifically those related to administrative boundary changes.  Immediately, my mind goes to the resolutions that often deal with provincial mergers and changes. I quickly identify Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which outlines the merging of Vĩnh Phúc, Phú Thọ, and Hòa Bình.  This is key information!  Vĩnh Phúc is now part of Phú Thọ. Therefore, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I zero in on the specific ward: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Now, the real detective work begins.  I need to find resolutions applicable to Phú Thọ, looking for any changes that might have affected \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, a resolution concerning administrative restructuring within Phú Thọ, immediately catches my eye.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI'm now scanning the document, specifically looking for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Line 67 states, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Tây Sơn, Cao Phong và Sơn Đông thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Sơn Đông**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Aha!  This directly implicates the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in a merger, resulting in the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is a strong lead!  It clearly indicates that the *old* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, I can't be complacent.  Line 91 of the same resolution also mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của thị trấn Cao Phong, xã Hợp Phong và xã Thu Phong thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Cao Phong**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This creates a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but it's based on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Cao Phong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This throws a bit of ambiguity into the picture. Is the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"? Or are there two entities both named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" after the restructuring?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConsidering the context and the nature of these resolutions, it's highly likely that the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I'm dealing with was incorporated into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as stated in line 67, and not the one created in line 91, which stems from a *thị trấn* and other *xã*. This reasoning is further supported by the current new wards list. It lists \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but the address specifies \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and the one referenced in the list is located in Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, my current assessment, based on the resolution's language, is that the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been re-designated as part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the new province of Phú Thọ.

My first step is straightforward: identifying the old province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Then, I need to check for any mergers or changes affecting Vĩnh Phúc.

I'm carefully examining the entries within that resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLine 67 is a direct hit: it clearly states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged, along with Tây Sơn and Sơn Đông, into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That seems like the most likely outcome for my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, line 91 throws a curveball. It talks about creating a *new* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Hợp Phong, and Thu Phong. That creates some ambiguity. Is the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I'm looking for the same as the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"? It's not immediately clear. The address I'm working with just says \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". And if that entity exists, where does it sit with the merge into Sơn Đông?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAdditionally, I have the new wards list which includes a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with a code, under the province of Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConsidering the phrasing of both lines, I'm leaning toward the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" outcome from line 67 being the correct mapping, especially since the old address refers specifically to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, I'm going to need to investigate this specific area and the histories of these entities, in order to confirm with a degree of certainty whether the input should map to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cao Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", or some other configuration of the two.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc, tỉnh Phú Thọ và tỉnh Hoà Bình; lấy tên là tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"08866\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Đông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1676/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"67.
