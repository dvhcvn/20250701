  "thought": "**Processing the Ward Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this ward mapping. I've got to take the user's input, map the old administrative unit (\"Xã Cao Phong, Huyện Sông Lô, Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\") to a new one, and present it in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I break down the user's information. I know the old ward, the relevant resolutions (especially `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Phú Thọ and the province merger resolution), a list of new wards, and the required output format.\n\nMy plan involves a step-by-step analysis. Starting with the old province, \"Tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc\", I identify it now belongs to \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" based on resolution `60-NQ/TW`. That narrows my search to Phú Thọ's resolution, `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15`.\n\nNow, I'm digging into `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15`, looking for any mention of \"Xã Cao Phong\" and/or \"Huyện Sông Lô\". Here's where it gets interesting. I find a crucial line (line 67) stating that \"Xã Cao Phong\" is merged into \"Xã Sơn Đông\".  But, there's a catch: the district isn't specified in that line, which gives me pause. And then, line 91, says \"thị trấn Cao Phong\" is merged into a new \"Xã Cao Phong\". A name match but also a type mismatch!\n\nMy next step is to evaluate these potential candidates. My primary candidate, \"Xã Sơn Đông,\" is compelling due to the direct name match in the resolution.  However, the lack of district information from the resolution introduces uncertainty, and thus a low confidence.  My next candidate, \"Xã Cao Phong\", is similar: it has a name match but is also a low-confidence candidate because the resolution says \"thị trấn Cao Phong\" is part of the merge, which introduces a type mismatch.  I also look for \"Xã Sông Lô,\" but that isn't included in the merged ward descriptions.\n\nConsidering the input data, and the nature of these merging processes, I'm going to include both of these results.  In the final JSON, I will have an array with two JSON objects, each with a `province_name`, `ward_name`, `ward_code`, `confidence`, and `citation`. I will be sure to label both with \"low\" confidence and include the corresponding line of the resolution for context. I think this gives the user a complete picture, even with the inherent ambiguities.\n\nI double-check everything: province mapping, the right resolution, and that I'm considering the edge cases and ambiguities with the merging data. It's a bit of a puzzle, but with the data available, I feel confident this is the best possible analysis.\n",
