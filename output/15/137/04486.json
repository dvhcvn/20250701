  "thought": "**Processing the Request to Map Old Administrative Units**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thinking. The user wants me to link an old ward, Xã Dế Su Phình from Yên Bái province, to its current counterpart based on resolutions. I'm going to start by breaking down the request: old ward, new ward mapping, a list of resolutions, and the required JSON output format. I'm familiar with this type of task.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what happened to the province and the district. I have the province merger resolution (60-NQ/TW), which clearly states that Yên Bái merged with Lào Cai. So, the new ward *must* be in Lào Cai province.\n\nNext, I understand that districts were eliminated. This tells me that the old Huyện Mù Căng Chải no longer exists as an administrative level. The specific details will be in the resolutions.\n\nNow comes the trickier part. I have a relevant resolution (1673/NQ-UBTVQH15) about the reorganization of wards in Lào Cai.  The resolution mentions the creation of a new \"Xã Mù Cang Chải\" from a merger of several units. It's in the right area. However, and this is key, *Xã Dế Su Phình is not mentioned directly in this specific text*. I do see that it discusses the restructuring of wards from the Mù Căng Chải district, which is promising.\n\nBased on the available information, it's very probable that Xã Dế Su Phình was also involved in the reorganization and is part of the new district. The proximity, the time frame, and the fact that it's from the same old administrative division makes it likely.  The issue is that I don't have *proof*. The provided snippet only details the new \"Xã Mù Cang Chải,\" and it doesn't mention the fates of the other wards.\n\nSo, while \"Xã Mù Cang Chải\" is the best candidate based on the available information, my confidence is low. I have to construct my JSON output accordingly. I'll include \"Xã Mù Cang Chải\" as a potential match, citing the relevant resolution and the specific line describing the merging of similar surrounding wards. Importantly, I'll indicate a \"low\" confidence level because of the missing information about \"Xã Dế Su Phình\". The citation will point to the relevant line in the resolution, showing *why* this is a likely match, even if I can't be certain.\n\nI believe this approach is technically correct, following the provided instructions to the best of my ability with the data I have. The final output is a single JSON array containing a single object, as required. My analysis reflects the information I've been given. The reasoning and caveats are all carefully documented in the output, and my confidence level has been set appropriately. I'm confident in the output's structure and the validity of the thought process behind it, given the limitations of the data.\n",

The user has given me resolutions and a list of new wards to work with.  My primary goal is to produce a JSON array with mappings and confidence levels, citing the relevant resolutions.\\n\\nFirst, I've broken down the request. I know the old ward, the required task, and the data available: resolutions (both provincial-level and more specific), and a list of new wards. I also have the output format and key requirements in mind – primarily, identifying potential new wards, assessing confidence, and providing citations.\\n\\nNext, I zeroed in on the old ward. The obvious facts are: it's in Mù Căng Chải district, Yên Bái province.\\n\\nNow, for the processing.  I started with the province-level changes. Resolution 60-NQ/TW shows that Yên Bái was merged into Lào Cai. This immediately narrows things down – the old ward is now part of Lào Cai.\\n\\nThen, I'm diving into the more specific resolution, 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15. I'm focusing on \\\"Huyện Mù Căng Chải\\\" because that's where the old ward is located.  Reading through the resolution, I found a line that deals with the consolidation of some wards in Mù Căng Chải into a new \\\"xã Mù Cang Chải\\\". However, and this is crucial, the specific ward I'm looking for, \\\"Xã Dế Su Phình,\\\" isn't mentioned in this particular merger. This is a crucial finding, and I am concerned, because it makes me think that, given the instructions, a fully confident conclusion is unlikely.\\n\\nBased on what I know now, I can confidently state that the old province of Yen Bai is now part of Lao Cai. However, the fate of \\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\" is unclear. The resolution focused on a consolidation to \\\"xã Mù Cang Chải,\\\" but Dế Su Phình wasn't explicitly included. Because the prompt stated that *all* districts were eliminated, I now realize this is where I must focus.\\n\\nGiven the information provided, and the wording of the prompt, my confidence level for a definite mapping is currently low, and I will be looking to justify this in my report. I will need to clarify the relationship of \\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\" to the newly created \\\"xã Mù Cang Chải\\\" and the prompt's condition.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lào Cai\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"04456\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Mù Cang Chải\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Dế Su Phình, Huyện Mù Căng Chải, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 14880,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0028658,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Analyzing the Ward Mapping Request**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: The user wants me to translate an old administrative unit into its current equivalent based on a series of resolutions. They've given me a specific old ward: Xã Dế Su Phình, Huyện Mù Căng Chải, Tỉnh Yên Bái. My task is to pinpoint the new ward(s) that encompass this old one, either entirely or partially.\\\\n\\\\nI need to use several documents: the province merger resolutions (like 60-NQ/TW) and more granular resolutions, such as `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Lào Cai province, and a list of updated wards. The user is expecting a JSON array, meticulously following a predefined schema, which includes identifying the relevant resolutions, the ward matches with confidence levels (high or low) and citations.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I examined the provided old ward. I noted it's in the old Yên Bái province, specifically in Mù Căng Chải district (though I'm mentally correcting the typo in the request). Now, step-by-step, I'll go through the process:\\\\n\\\\n**Province Mergers and the Impact on Yên Bái:**\\\\n\\\\nThe first critical step involves resolution 60-NQ/TW to see how the province of Yên Bái was affected. It clearly outlines the merger of Lào Cai and Yên Bái into a new province named Lào Cai. So, that's the first major piece of information. The old ward, situated in Yên Bái, is therefore now located within Lào Cai.\\\\n\\\\n**District and Ward-Level Resolutions:**\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to investigate the other resolution provided, `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which details the re-organization of administrative units within Lào Cai, to determine what happened to Mù Căng Chải district. The resolution indicates that some wards within Mù Căng Chải merged to form \\\\\\\"xã Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\" Specifically, \\\\\\\"thị trấn Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"xã Kim Nọi, Mồ Dề, Chế Cu Nha\\\\\\\" are mentioned. However, and this is crucial, the specific old ward, \\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình,\\\\\\\" *isn't* mentioned. The user's prompt suggested all districts are eliminated, which means \\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\" would have to be re-assigned.\\\\n\\\\n**Assessing the Findings and Determining Confidence:**\\\\n\\\\nSo, here's where I stand: I know the old ward's province is now Lào Cai. I've found a resolution covering administrative changes in the Mù Căng Chải area, but \\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\" isn't included in the merging. I know that the prompt says all districts are eliminated, but the resolution doesn't specify its new location. I can *infer* it's somewhere in Lào Cai, but can't specify a new ward with certainty. This lack of certainty will be clearly reflected in the confidence level.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"04456\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình, Huyện Mù Căng Chải, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 14271,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0024908,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Navigating the Administrative Unit Restructuring for Xã Dế Su Phình**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, let's break this down. The user's asking me to find the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình, Huyện Mù Căng Chải, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  My initial thought is, this is likely a province merger situation. So, I need to methodically check the following:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, let's establish the baseline. We're looking at \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mù Căng Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (district, correctly spelled now) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the province).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow for the interesting bit.  I know *Tỉnh Yên Bái* isn't around anymore. I remember the province mergers under Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Sure enough, item 2 states the merger of *Yên Bái* and *Lào Cai* into a new province *Lào Cai*.  So, *Yên Bái* is now part of *Lào Cai*. Good, we have our provincial shift.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe user also provided Resolution 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15, which is relevant because we're now dealing with *Lào Cai*. Excellent! It mentions *Mù Cang Chải* (the district's corrected spelling) and details how specific wards and the town of Mù Cang Chải have been combined to form the new *Xã Mù Cang Chải*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, and this is the crux of it, *Xã Dế Su Phình* is *not* mentioned in this resolution. It deals with other merging wards. The resolution details merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Kim Nọi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Mồ Dề\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Chế Cu Nha\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It's not the same.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nA quick check against my database confirms the new ward *Xã Mù Cang Chải* exists within *Tỉnh Lào Cai*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the important part.  While *Xã Dế Su Phình* isn't directly mentioned, it was clearly part of the restructuring because it belonged to the same district, *Mù Cang Chải*, that is being addressed in this resolution. *All* the areas within *Mù Cang Chải* (which is now a part of Lào Cai) are covered by the resolution. It's safe to assume this is not a coincidence, it's just not explicitly stated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, because this restructuring covers all the administrative areas of Mù Cang Chải, even if *Dế Su Phình* isn't *directly* mentioned in the text, it is part of this shift.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"04456\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình, Huyện Mù Căng Chải, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 9778,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0028458,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Administrative Maze: Mapping an Old Address**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tackling this address mapping problem. The goal is to figure out where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from Huyện Mù Căng Chải, Tỉnh Yên Bái now resides in the updated administrative landscape.  I have some resolutions and a new ward entry to work with.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy initial thought is to break this down into manageable chunks. First, I identify the address components: the ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), the district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mù Căng Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), and the province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I dive into the Provincial Resolutions (like 60-NQ/TW).  Right off the bat, I see that Yên Bái isn't on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"do not merge\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list.  Digging deeper, I find the bombshell:  Yên Bái merged into Lào Cai!  So, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" becomes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  That's straightforward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, I look at the other resolutions, specifically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1673/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This one's about Lào Cai, which is relevant now that Yên Bái is part of it.  I zero in on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mù Căng Chải,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the old district. The resolution mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and specific communes. It's clear that these areas are consolidating into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  But here's the rub: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* explicitly mentioned in this resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm thinking, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Is there a connection?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The district names are remarkably similar:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mù Căng Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  And since Yên Bái merged into Lào Cai, it's highly likely they are connected.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere’s the issue: the resolution *specifically* lists the components that make up the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't among them. This means I can't definitively say that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" ended up *directly* within this new ward. The resolution details what becomes “Xã Mù Cang Chải,” so anything not listed is a question.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I consider the provided new ward data: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (04456).  This is consistent with the resolution, but it *doesn't* confirm \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *part* of it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, here's my conclusion:  The province mapping is clear: Yên Bái becomes Lào Cai. However, based on the *provided* resolutions, I cannot confidently say that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been mapped to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The specific old ward isn't mentioned, and the resolution explicitly lists what makes up the new ward.  Therefore, I'd have to assign a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" confidence to any proposed mapping of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I'd need further documentation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Lào Cai và tỉnh Yên Bái, lấy tên là tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"04456\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n  ],\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình, Huyện Mù Căng Chải, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 7926,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0028458,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Murky Waters of Address Transformation**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAlright, let's break this down. We're tasked with mapping an old address to a new administrative unit. We've got the old address components: Xã Dế Su Phình, Huyện Mù Căng Chải, and Tỉnh Yên Bái.  The challenge lies in reconciling this with the provided resolutions and the new ward data, especially with the potential for administrative restructuring.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, the province is straightforward. Resolution 60-NQ/TW tells us that Yên Bái is no longer a standalone province; it's been merged into Lào Cai. So, that's easy: Tỉnh Yên Bái becomes Tỉnh Lào Cai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the ward and district are the tricky part.  Resolution 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key resolution for this, deals with restructuring in Lào Cai. However, here's where it gets confusing: while it mentions Mù Căng Chải, it's referring to the Thị Trấn Mù Căng Chải and specific communes that are being merged into the new Xã Mù Cang Chải. Crucially, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the original address is *not* explicitly mentioned in this list.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe obvious similarity of the district name Huyện Mù Căng Chải in Yên Bái (now part of Lào Cai) to Thị Trấn Mù Căng Chải is too great to ignore.  It's very likely they're related, but the lack of direct mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dế Su Phình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the resolution is a major sticking point.  It's possible Dế Su Phình was merged elsewhere, or retained its own identity (less likely given the nature of the resolution).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWe *do* have the new ward data, which, according to the resolutions, is a consequence of the merging.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe new ward we have for this mapping is Xã Mù Cang Chải, which would normally make me happy. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore,  I can't definitively link the old ward, Xã Dế Su Phình, to the new ward, Xã Mù Cang Chải, with high confidence based solely on the data we have.  The fact that Dế Su Phình doesn't show up in the specific merging process described in the resolution is a red flag.  This is a case where we need more information. My confidence level on this particular link is low because of the missing data around Dế Su Phình. We know the old province maps, but not definitively the ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Lào Cai và tỉnh Yên Bái, lấy tên là tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"04456\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mù Cang Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
