  "thought": "**Processing the Mapping Request: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, I've got the user's request. My task is to figure out the new administrative equivalent of \"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\" based on the provided resolutions. This is a classic administrative mapping problem, and I need to be thorough.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the inputs. I've got the old ward's name and its administrative context (district and province). Then, I have two key resolutions: `60-NQ/TW` and `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  `60-NQ/TW` likely deals with province mergers, while `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15` seems to focus on ward-level changes.  Finally, there's the list of new wards.\n\nMy initial approach will be a top-down analysis, starting with province-level changes, then moving to district and ward details.\n\n**Step 1: Province-Level Analysis**\n\nThe old ward is in `Tỉnh Yên Bái`. The resolution `60-NQ/TW` should tell me what happened to that province.  Ah, here it is: \"Hợp nhất tỉnh Lào Cai và tỉnh Yên Bái, lấy tên là tỉnh Lào Cai.\"  Excellent.  `Tỉnh Yên Bái` has merged into `Tỉnh Lào Cai`.  So, the new ward *must* be within `Lào Cai`.\n\n**Step 2: District and Ward Scrutiny**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on the district and ward level.  The user says all districts are eliminated, which means I should carefully review resolution `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15` as it applies to the new province. This resolution *should* contain the information.  The old ward is in `Huyện Văn Chấn`.  I need to search the resolution for mentions of `Huyện Văn Chấn` and its constituent wards, especially `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn`.\n\nAfter carefully examining the text of `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`, I see a mention of `thị trấn Sơn Thịnh` and subsequent mentions of formations of new xãs. Crucially, I notice:\n*   `11. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của thị trấn Sơn Thịnh và các xã Đồng Khê, Suối Bu, Suối Giàng thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Văn Chấn.`\n*   `13. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Tân Thịnh (huyện Văn Chấn), Đại Lịch và Chấn Thịnh thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Chấn Thịnh.`\n\nNeither mentions `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn`. This is a crucial finding. This means it either has been renamed, kept its name but fell into a different formation, or simply isn't explicitly mentioned in this document. Since there are no clues as to the outcome of Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn, and the user demands the inclusion of *all* possible options based on the provided information, I must conclude there is no applicable output.\n\n**Synthesis and Decision**\n\nLet me sum up. The province mapping is straightforward: `Yên Bái` -> `Lào Cai`. However, the ward-level information is inconclusive. The provided resolution only covers the merging or formation of a specific set of wards within the former `Huyện Văn Chấn`.  `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn` isn't mentioned.\n\nI need to be pragmatic here. The request states, \"If there are insufficient information or otherwise you are not sure, indicate that the confidence is low.\" Since I cannot pinpoint a direct mapping for `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn`, and cannot make *any* assumptions beyond the provided text, and I need to include *all* possible options, my confidence is extremely low.  Suggesting any of the two *new* xãs would be mere speculation. Hence, an empty array `[]` is the appropriate response to represent \"no mapping found.\"\n\n**Final Validation**\n\nBefore I submit my conclusion, I will perform a final check.  I need to ensure that the logic holds, and the formatting is correct. Everything points to \"no matching information found\". The output should be a JSON array. An empty array is the precise way to express this. My conclusion is, \"[]\".\n",

My starting point is breaking this down into manageable steps.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out where \\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\" (Yên Bái Province) ended up. The key here is Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which states that Yên Bái was merged with Lào Cai to form the new province \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\" (Lào Cai Province). Now, the old unit, although located in the old province, is now within the new province of Lào Cai.\\n\\nNext, I have to delve into the district and ward level details. The request indicates all districts were eliminated, so I need to focus on what happened to \\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\" (Văn Chấn District). The primary resolution for that is `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which is focused on changes within Lào Cai province.\\n\\nI've carefully read through the lines of `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`. Line 11 mentions \\\"xã Văn Chấn,\\\" which is interesting because that relates to the old district name. However, the listed old units are \\\"thị trấn Sơn Thịnh,\\\" \\\"xã Đồng Khê,\\\" \\\"Suối Bu,\\\" and \\\"Suối Giàng,\\\" none of which match \\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn.\\\" Line 13, concerning \\\"xã Chấn Thịnh,\\\" is equally unhelpful.\\n\\nTherefore, because \\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn\\\" isn't specifically mentioned in the resolutions, I need to consider a **low** confidence level at this time. I have a province match but a ward-level resolution isn't providing a clear association. More investigation might be required to achieve a higher confidence result.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lào Cai\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 17085,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0035141999999999994,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Thought Process: Mapping an Old Vietnamese Address**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm given an old Vietnamese address and need to figure out its new administrative unit based on some provided resolutions. Let's break this down.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the user's request. They've given me an old address: `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái`. I'm also armed with resolutions, specifically `60-NQ/TW` and `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`, and a list of new wards with their corresponding codes and names. My job is to analyze the old address, check the provincial and ward-level resolutions, identify the new administrative unit, and then generate a JSON output based on the provided schema, including a confidence level.\\\\n\\\\nLet's dive in. The old address is `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái`. Breaking it down, we have the ward, district, and province. I need to figure out what's changed since then, especially at the provincial and ward levels.\\\\n\\\\nThe first step is checking `60-NQ/TW`. This will contain information about provincial mergers. I need to find out what happened to `Tỉnh Yên Bái`. Bingo! The resolution clearly states that `Tỉnh Yên Bái` merged with `Tỉnh Lào Cai`, now forming a single entity named `Tỉnh Lào Cai`. This is significant!\\\\n\\\\nNow, I'll analyze the ward-level resolution, `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which is for `Tỉnh Lào Cai`. Since `Yên Bái` is now part of `Lào Cai`, this is relevant. This resolution details mergers within the district of `Văn Chấn`. I need to see if the old ward, `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn`, is mentioned.\\\\n\\\\nI meticulously reviewed the lines within `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`, but unfortunately, `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn` isn't there. There are mergers and name changes for wards within `Huyện Văn Chấn`, but not for this specific ward.\\\\n\\\\nI've also examined the list of new wards provided, but neither `Xã Văn Chấn` nor `Xã Chấn Thịnh` seem to directly correlate with `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn` based on the given information.\\\\n\\\\nSo here's the crux: the old province is now part of Lào Cai, confirmed. But, based on the provided documents, I can't pinpoint the exact new ward for `Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn`. I also note that the prompt says to \\\\\\\"indicate that the confidence is low\\\\\\\" if I'm not sure. Since I can't find a direct mapping, I'm going to set my confidence as low and note that I have insufficient information to determine the exact new ward from these sources.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 7958,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0028116999999999994,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Navigating the Complexities of Vietnamese Administrative Restructuring**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with a bit of a challenge. I need to map this old Vietnamese address, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to its new administrative unit. The prompt eliminates districts, so I'll focus on the province and ward.  My primary strategy will be to use the resolutions and new ward data provided.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the components of the old address: the old ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), the old province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), and the old district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" – primarily for context).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, I immediately zeroed in on the province merger (Resolution 60-NQ/TW). Bingo! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is mentioned in a merger, becoming part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  So, my new province is definitely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  That part's straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the trickier part: ward restructuring. I'm looking at the provided \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and specifically, I've got \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1673/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Lào Cai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is where it gets interesting because this is for the *new* province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lào Cai,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which includes the *old* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Yên Bái.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I need to figure out how the old wards from Yên Bái are being incorporated into this new structure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI'm carefully examining the lines in the resolution.  I found that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Sơn Thịnh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đồng Khê,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Suối Bu,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Suối Giàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are being merged into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Chấn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Also \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tân Thịnh (huyện Văn Chấn),\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đại Lịch,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Chấn Thịnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are becoming a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Chấn Thịnh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But here's the rub: my old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned as one of the units being merged into either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Chấn Thịnh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  My instinct is to relate it to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" because of the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Chấn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, my data doesn't explicitly confirm this connection.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI also checked the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data, which confirms \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Chấn Thịnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" exist in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in the restructuring of wards, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is no longer relevant, I can confidently state that the *new* province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Unfortunately, I don't have enough data to determine *precisely* which new ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Liên Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" belongs to, either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Chấn Thịnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

The provided \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" section points me to 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Crucially, this is the *new* province, meaning it *includes* the old units of Yên Bái that are being restructured.
