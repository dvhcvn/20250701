  "thought": "**Determining the New Ward for the Given Address**\n\nOkay, so I've got this old address: \"Xã Nghĩa Sơn, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái,\" and I need to figure out the new ward it now belongs to.  First things first, I know the province has potentially changed due to mergers.  I checked the \"60-NQ/TW\" resolution and found that Yên Bái was merged with Lào Cai.  Therefore, my address now starts as \"Xã Nghĩa Sơn, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Lào Cai.\"\n\nNow, the trick is to cross-reference this with the relevant resolutions to see where \"Xã Nghĩa Sơn\" ended up.  Since the province is now Lào Cai, my focus shifts to resolution \"1673/NQ-UBTVQH15,\" which deals with restructuring administrative units within that province.\n\nThis is where it gets a little tricky.  I spotted a couple of potential matches. First, line 11 mentions \"Xã Văn Chấn,\" which initially made me think \"aha! District and Ward.\" But I had to reread and ensure that the \"Văn Chấn\" there referred to the *ward*.  Line 13 mentions that district in detail, and confirms it.  Then, finally, line 82 jumps out at me: it clearly states that \"xã Nghĩa Sơn\" is being merged into \"phường Nghĩa Lộ.\"\n\nSo, after a thorough review of the province and then this particular resolution, it seems pretty clear that the old \"Xã Nghĩa Sơn\" is now part of the new \"phường Nghĩa Lộ.\"  The ambiguity about \"Văn Chấn\" was resolved by clarifying its role in the resolution's restructuring. Therefore I am very confident with the result.\n",
