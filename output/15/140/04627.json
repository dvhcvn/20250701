  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to figure out the new location of an old administrative unit, \"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái,\" using some resolutions. It's my job to figure this out based on these resolutions and a list of new wards. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial setup. I've got the old ward's name and its province, \"Tỉnh Yên Bái,\" and a few resolutions to use. Also, there's a list of new wards with their codes and province names.\n\nAlright, the process seems pretty straightforward:\n\n1.  **Province Mapping:** I've got to start with the province. The old ward is in \"Tỉnh Yên Bái,\" and I need to consult `60-NQ/TW` to find out what happened to it. Ah, here it is: \"Hợp nhất tỉnh Lào Cai và tỉnh Yên Bái, lấy tên là tỉnh Lào Cai.\" So, \"Tỉnh Yên Bái\" is now part of \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\" That's the first crucial step.\n\n2.  **District/Ward Mapping:** Next, I've got to look at the district/ward level. The old ward is in \"Huyện Văn Chấn.\" The instruction says to consider that districts have been eliminated. Therefore, the area of former \"Huyện Văn Chấn\" is now reorganized within the new \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\"\n\n    *   The user provided `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Lào Cai`, which should be relevant.\n    *   I've read through the lines: one merging some wards into \"Xã Văn Chấn,\" and another merging into \"Xã Chấn Thịnh.\"\n    *   However, my target, \"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú,\" isn't mentioned anywhere in this resolution. It doesn't appear in either of the described merges. I also note that these described merges contain other communes from the same old district: \"Huyện Văn Chấn,\" thus I assume that the resolution applies to that region.\n\n3.  **Synthesizing the Information:**\n\n    *   Province \"Tỉnh Yên Bái\" is now part of \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\" Got it.\n    *   My target was in \"Huyện Văn Chấn.\" Got it.\n    *   The provided resolution addresses some communes from \"Huyện Văn Chấn\" for the area that is now \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\" Okay.\n    *   But... the key point here is that \"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\" is not present in this resolution. It isn't mentioned. That is the critical roadblock.\n    *   The new wards listed (\"Xã Văn Chấn\", \"Xã Chấn Thịnh\") are formed from *other* old communes within the same former district. Okay.\n    *   Since I can't find anything related to \"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\" in the information, I can't definitively determine its new location. I don't have enough to connect it to the merges listed.\n\n4.  **Formulating the JSON response:**\n\n    *   It seems the right thing to do here is to return an empty array, `[]`, signifying that there's no mapping found because I don't have enough information to make a determination, and the instructions specifically say to do this.\n    *   The prompt did say to indicate a low confidence, but in this case, the resolution does not even mention the name of the ward. There isn't even a low confidence; it's just zero, no match, due to insufficient information.\n    *   Given the prompt instructions, `[]` is the correct response here. This is the only valid outcome based on the available information.\n\n5.  **Final Verification:** I double-checked everything to make sure, so now I know I am confident that there is no match to be found with the data.\n",

I need to be thorough and precise.\\n\\nFirst, I break down the request. The old administrative unit is clear: \\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\". My task is to find the *new* unit or units it's been merged into, either fully or partially. The data includes Province Resolutions (specifically, 60-NQ/TW), resolutions detailing ward-level changes (1673/NQ-UBTVQH15), and a list of new wards with their details. The expected output is a specific JSON array format.\\n\\nNow, the methodical analysis: First, I break down the old unit itself into its components: ward, district, and province. Then, I dive into the Province Resolutions. My goal is to determine what happened to \\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\". Bingo! Item 2 states that \\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\" merged with \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\" to become \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\". That's a key piece of information! The new equivalent has to be within \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\".\\n\\nNext, I shift focus to the other resolutions, particularly 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15, which focuses on ward-level changes within \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\". I'm specifically looking for any references to \\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\" or any of its wards. Reading through the provided lines, I find Line 11 and Line 13. However, the old ward, \\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\", isn't explicitly listed in either. Line 11 and Line 13 describe the merging of other wards into the new \\\"Xã Văn Chấn\\\" and \\\"Xã Chấn Thịnh\\\", respectively, which are located in old \\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\".\\n\\nSynthesizing my findings, here's the current state: I know the old province is now part of \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\".  I know the old ward isn't mentioned in the provided resolution detailing the latest ward-level changes in that region. This presents a bit of a challenge. I need to continue my investigation to determine the best next steps, possibly by consulting other resources. Based on this information alone, my confidence level for a definitive mapping is currently **low**. I'll need to explore further to complete this mapping accurately.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lào Cai\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 14406,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0030117,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Address Mapping Analysis: A Thought Process**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this address mapping problem. First, I need to understand the request: the goal is to find the new address equivalent for an old Vietnamese address using a set of resolutions and a list of new wards.\\\\n\\\\nI'm starting by breaking down the old address:  \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\". I know \\\\\\\"NT\\\\\\\" stands for \\\\\\\"Nông trường\\\\\\\" (State farm). So, it's a state farm town in Văn Chấn district, Yên Bái province.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I'll dive into the resolutions. First, \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\" deals with provincial changes. I need to find what happened to Yên Bái. Scanning the list, I see it merged with Lào Cai to form a new province called \\\\\\\"Lào Cai.\\\\\\\" That's the easy part!\\\\n\\\\nNow, the trickier bit. \\\\\\\"1673/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\\\\\" focuses on ward-level changes, but *only* for Lào Cai. Since Yên Bái is now part of Lào Cai, this is relevant.  I see it covers Văn Chấn district, which is good.  I need to check if the old \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\" is mentioned.  Scanning the relevant lines... nope. No mention.  They *do* discuss forming new wards from other old wards *within* Văn Chấn district, like  \\\\\\\"Văn Chấn\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Chấn Thịnh.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow, looking at the list of new wards, it shows \\\\\\\"Xã Văn Chấn\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Chấn Thịnh\\\\\\\", both in Lào Cai.  These are *possibly* where the old \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\" ended up, but the resolutions don't explicitly say so.\\\\n\\\\nSo, here's my assessment:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Province Mapping:** Clear and certain: Yên Bái -> Lào Cai.\\\\n*   **Ward Mapping:**  Unclear.  While I know the district remains the same, the specific old \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\" isn't mentioned. It's *possible* it was absorbed into \\\\\\\"Xã Văn Chấn\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Xã Chấn Thịnh\\\\\\\" or *possibly* it remains intact, but the data is inconclusive.\\\\n\\\\nMy confidence level is therefore medium.  I have a good provincial mapping, but a weak or potentially incorrect ward mapping.  This would require additional confirmation from another source.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 8502,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0028091999999999995,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Navigating the Complexities of Vietnamese Address Mapping**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm tasked with transforming an old Vietnamese address into its contemporary administrative unit equivalent. The old address is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". My process is broken down into a series of logical steps, each crucial to achieving a definitive mapping.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to break down the old address. I've identified \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the old district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the old province. Remember, the prompt emphasizes eliminating districts, so I'm focusing primarily on province and ward transformations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe next step involves the province mergers outlined in document 60-NQ/TW. This is where things get interesting. I've found a relevant entry detailing the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into a new province. Crucially, the outcome is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", making that my new province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I turn my attention to the ward-level resolutions, specifically those pertaining to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". These resolutions should reveal how old wards have been reconfigured. Looking through the provided list, I'm hoping to find \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" directly or any associated entities. My initial scan reveals a few lines that appear relevant: specifically lines 11 & 13 of Resolution 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15. However, while these mention the merger of specific *xã* (communes) from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", they do not include \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It is important to note that the prompt instructs us to eliminate district information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDelving deeper, I can see that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is mentioned in the source of some of the wards listed, which confirms its prior existence. Moreover, line 13's mention of Tân Thịnh, a commune in Văn Chấn, reinforces my understanding of the pre-existing structure. But, my target ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains elusive.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAt this point, I have to be realistic. My confidence level is dropping. I can't definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a specific new ward based on the resolutions provided. The evidence is simply insufficient. While the resolutions shed light on the province-level changes, they fail to provide a direct mapping for this particular ward. The old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a key element of the historical administrative geography, but I need a direct match or enough circumstantial evidence, but none is forthcoming. Therefore, I must conclude with a low confidence level and a preliminary assessment of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the new province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Lào Cai và tỉnh Yên Bái, lấy tên là tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 7831,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0028091999999999995,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Vietnamese Administrative Landscape**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with a task: to translate an old Vietnamese address (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú, Huyện Văn Chấn, Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") into its contemporary administrative unit equivalent, and I've got some resolutions to work with.  The prompt is clear: focus on province and ward transformations, and eliminate any district level concerns.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the components: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old province, with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being the old district.  The province aspect is straightforward. Looking at the province merger details, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Yên Bái\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is absorbed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so that's my starting point.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, for the tricky part: the ward mapping.  The provided resolutions are specific to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which aligns with the province merger.  I need to see if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or any directly related names show up.  Scanning the resolutions, I find lines concerning the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Sơn Thịnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and some communes from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Văn Chấn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". And another resolution mentioning that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"các xã Tân Thịnh (huyện Văn Chấn), Đại Lịch và Chấn Thịnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" become the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Chấn Thịnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere's the rub: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't appear anywhere in these resolutions.  While the resolutions do reference \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Chấn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that's the district, and the task is to ignore district level data.  They're using the district as a *source* of merging communes, but I'm looking for the *destination*, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't fit here.  Those resolutions are not referencing my specific ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy analysis boils down to this: I know the old province is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" due to the merger, but the resolutions provided don't give me any clear or confident information on where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" belongs. There's no direct mapping to a new ward based on the information given. Since I cannot definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with the information provided, I'd have to rate the confidence of any mapping attempt as low. The resolution only mentions old district level entities.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, the only thing I can confidently output is the new province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Any mapping for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Trần Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would need further information to improve the confidence level of a ward mapping.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Lào Cai và tỉnh Yên Bái, lấy tên là tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
