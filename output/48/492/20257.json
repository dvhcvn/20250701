  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Address Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this address mapping problem. First, I need to understand what's being asked. It's about translating an old address to its current form based on boundary changes. The specific address is \"Phường Hòa Cường Bắc, Quận Hải Châu, Thành phố Đà Nẵng,\" and I have to find its new equivalent.\n\nMy process will involve looking at province and ward-level data, including resolutions and any new ward information provided.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the address. The old ward is \"Phường Hòa Cường Bắc,\" and the province is \"Thành phố Đà Nẵng.\" Now, let's see if province-level resolutions like \"60-NQ/TW\" have any impacts. Ah, yes, \"60-NQ/TW\" mentions Đà Nẵng but it essentially confirms the name remains the same as it was after a merger in the past. So, my confidence in the province name \"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\" is high because of the resolution I found.\n\nNext up, I need to check resolutions regarding specific wards. I'm focusing on \"Phường Hòa Cường Bắc\" now. Resolution \"1659/NQ-UBTVQH15\" is interesting. It clearly states the arrangement of several wards including \"Hòa Cường Bắc\" into a new ward called \"Hòa Cường.\" Bingo! This is the core of the mapping. This resolution indicates that \"Phường Hòa Cường Bắc\" has merged into the new \"Phường Hòa Cường.\"\n\nI then need to make sure this new ward is represented in the provided data. Sure enough, there it is: `{\"ward_code\":\"20257\",\"ward_name\":\"Phường Hòa Cường\",\"province_name\":\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\"}`. It's a perfect match!\n\nNow, it's about constructing the output. I'm confident about my findings. The `citation` will be from resolution \"1659/NQ-UBTVQH15\" because that is the critical resolution. The `confidence` is high because I have a direct match between the resolution and the new ward data. The `province_name` is \"Thành phố Đà Nẵng,\" as confirmed by that resolution and earlier checks. The `ward_code` will be \"20257,\" and the `ward_name` is \"Phường Hòa Cường.\"\n\nLet's do a quick double-check. The old address is Phường Hòa Cường Bắc in Đà Nẵng. I identified the province resolution and I also found the exact resolution stating that the old ward is now part of the new ward, which is in the new wards data. Therefore, the mapping process is complete. High confidence.\n",
