  "thought": "**Analysis of Vietnamese Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old administrative unit `Xã Phước Thiền, Huyện Nhơn Trạch, Tỉnh Đồng Nai` and need to figure out its current state. My expert assessment begins with a methodical approach.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial data. I know I'm dealing with `Xã Phước Thiền` (the ward), located within `Huyện Nhơn Trạch` (the district) in `Tỉnh Đồng Nai` (the province).\n\nThe starting point is to understand the implications of the provided province resolution. It confirms that `Tỉnh Đồng Nai` is still a valid province, but it now also encompasses the former `Tỉnh Bình Phước`. While the province name remains, it's not a direct factor in ward-level changes.\n\nThe critical piece of the puzzle is resolution `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15`. I immediately zero in on it, knowing this is where the details of this specific administrative re-organization will reside.\n\nCarefully reading through it line by line, I find a crucial sentence: \"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của thị trấn Hiệp Phước và các xã Long Tân (huyện Nhơn Trạch), Phú Thạnh, Phú Hội, **Phước Thiền** thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Nhơn Trạch**.\" Bingo! This explicitly states that `Xã Phước Thiền` is merged with other units to form the new `Xã Nhơn Trạch`. I need to make sure I get the spelling right.\n\nI also noticed another line that has the spelling of \"Phước Thiện,\" but this refers to a different ward. I need to remember the difference: \"Thiện\" vs \"Thiền\".\n\nMy analysis then shifts to the `New wards` list. I'm looking for a match for the new ward that contains `Phước Thiền`. The provided list includes `{\"ward_code\":\"26485\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Nhơn Trạch\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\"}`. Perfect! This confirms that the new ward is indeed `Xã Nhơn Trạch`, and it resides within `Tỉnh Đồng Nai`, which is exactly as I expected.\n\nTherefore, my final expert conclusion is that the old `Xã Phước Thiền, Huyện Nhơn Trạch, Tỉnh Đồng Nai` has been merged into the new administrative unit `Xã Nhơn Trạch`, which is part of the current province `Tỉnh Đồng Nai`, with the ward code being `26485`.\n",

The user is looking for the updated administrative unit for \\\"Xã Phước Thiền, Huyện Nhơn Trạch, Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\\\" My initial thought is to analyze the input address: It's in Đồng Nai province, Nhơn Trạch district, and the specific ward is Phước Thiền.\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the Provincial Resolutions (60-NQ/TW). That seems to be more about province mergers. It looks like Đồng Nai hasn't changed its name, even if it's been redefined, so that's not the primary factor here. However, resolutions 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, focus on merging wards within Đồng Nai. Bingo!\\n\\nI immediately zeroed in on the lines that explicitly mention \\\"Phước Thiền.\\\" Line 2 is particularly interesting: it indicates that \\\"Xã Phước Thiền\\\" and a few other wards are merging to form a new ward called \\\"Xã Nhơn Trạch.\\\" That's a strong lead!\\n\\nHowever, Line 51 also caught my attention. It mentions \\\"Xã Phước Thiện\\\" and says it's merged with another ward to form \\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\". Since the input is \\\"Phước Thiền\\\", these are very similar, warranting consideration as a potential typo or a related name confusion. So, I see this as a *possible* scenario, giving me a low-confidence match.\\n\\nLooking at the list of new wards, it confirms what I suspected. I see both potential results: \\\"Xã Nhơn Trạch\\\" from line 2 and \\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\" from the low-confidence matching line 51. Given the slight name discrepancy, I'd present both of these as potential candidates to the user, with the clear indication that \\\"Xã Nhơn Trạch\\\" from Line 2 is the most likely.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1662/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đồng Nai\",\n        \"line\": \"2.
