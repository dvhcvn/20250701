  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \"Xã Suối Nho, Huyện Định Quán, Tỉnh Đồng Nai\" and I need to figure out its new administrative unit. My initial thought is to cross-reference this information with relevant resolutions and the most up-to-date ward data.\n\nFirst, I identified the key components: \"Xã Suối Nho\" (the old ward) and \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\" (the province). Then, I immediately checked Province Resolutions to see if \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\" had undergone any name changes or mergers. Thankfully, resolution 60-NQ/TW clarified that even though Đồng Nai merged with Bình Phước, the province retained its name. This keeps things straightforward.\n\nNext, I delved into other relevant resolutions. Resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15 became crucial. Point 27 was a direct hit: it states explicitly that \"Xã Suối Nho\" was merged with \"Xã Xuân Bắc\" to form a new ward, also named \"Xã Xuân Bắc.\" Fantastic! That's the core of my answer.\n\nTo solidify my confidence, I confirmed that \"Xã Xuân Bắc\" exists in the \"New Wards\" data for \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\". It's there, with the correct ward code and province information. No surprises there.\n\nI also considered other factors. Resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15 provides further context. Point 89 lists units *not* rearranged, and \"Xã Suối Nho\" isn't on that list. This supports the fact that it *was* rearranged. Point 29 deals with Định Quán town, but this information is consistent within the same district of interest. Point 27 clearly deals with the merger that I need to find the answer.\n\nTherefore, my expert conclusion is that \"Xã Suối Nho\" has been merged into \"Xã Xuân Bắc.\" This conclusion is strongly supported by the direct statement in the resolution. I'm quite confident in this assessment.\n",
