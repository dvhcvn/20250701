  "thought": "**Administrative Unit Determination: Xã Phú Cường, Huyện Định Quán, Tỉnh Đồng Nai**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this, breaking it down into my thought process.  I need to find the new administrative unit for \"Xã Phú Cường, Huyện Định Quán, Tỉnh Đồng Nai\".\n\nFirst, I clarified the input:  I'm looking for the new ward name, given the old ward name \"Xã Phú Cường,\" old district \"Huyện Định Quán,\" and old province \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\"\n\nNext, I noted that resolution `60-NQ/TW` confirms the province name \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\" is still valid, even though it now includes what was formerly Bình Phước. Critically, this resolution also confirmed the elimination of district-level administration.\n\nThen, I went hunting for mentions of \"Phú Cường\" within these resolutions, focusing on the Đồng Nai context.  I started with `1656/NQ-UBTVQH15`, but quickly realized these were matches for Phú Cường in Hà Nội.  Same story with `1658/NQ-UBTVQH15` from Bắc Ninh.\n\nI struck gold with `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Đồng Nai). Line 16 mentioned merging \"Phú Cường\" with \"Gia Tân 1, Gia Tân 2, and Phú Túc\" to form \"Xã Thống Nhất\".  Line 29 from the same resolution dealt specifically with Định Quán, but didn't mention Phú Cường. The absence of \"Phú Cường\" in the list of unchanged communes suggested it was merged. *However*, the fact that Gia Tân 1, 2 and Phú Túc were historically in Thống Nhất district created an ambiguity, since my input said Định Quán.\n\nI thoroughly checked the other resolutions for Phú Cường mentions in other provinces (`1663` to `1685`), finding only irrelevant matches (e.g., Phú Cường in Đồng Tháp, Hưng Yên, Phú Thọ, Thái Nguyên, and Hồ Chí Minh).\n\nComing back to the critical `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15`, Line 16 in Đồng Nai. *This is where I hit my main point of uncertainty.*  The input specifies \"Huyện Định Quán,\" yet the resolution seemed to imply a merge *into* something historically associated with Thống Nhất district. This suggests two possibilities: either the resolution is slightly inaccurate in that regard, with the old district lines becoming less relevant under the new administrative structure, or perhaps the \"Phú Cường\" from Định Quán was somehow merged into the \"Thống Nhất\" process along with the other communes. Given this, I needed to check against a list of new wards for \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\". I confirmed that the list included both \"Xã Thống Nhất\" with code 26299 and \"Xã Định Quán\" with code 26206.\n\nFrom this list and `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15`, it seemed like Phú Cường (likely the one from Thống Nhất district) was likely merged into Thống Nhất. The Định Quán resolution did not list the \"Phú Cường\" of the input, making it unlikely that it was merged to become Định Quán.\n\n*My key conclusion is that line 16 of `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15` is the best indicator.* While the district context creates some confusion, it's the only direct merging of a \"xã Phú Cường\" that I found. As such, the most probable result is that, regardless of its original district, the old \"Xã Phú Cường\" is now \"Xã Thống Nhất\" - and I'll mark that with a *low* confidence level because of that district-related ambiguity.\n",
