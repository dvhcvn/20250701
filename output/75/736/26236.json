  "thought": "**Administrative Unit Determination: Xã Phú Cường, Huyện Định Quán, Tỉnh Đồng Nai**\n\nOkay, here's how I'd approach this, breaking it down into my thought process.  I need to find the new administrative unit for \"Xã Phú Cường, Huyện Định Quán, Tỉnh Đồng Nai\".\n\nFirst, I clarified the input:  I'm looking for the new ward name, given the old ward name \"Xã Phú Cường,\" old district \"Huyện Định Quán,\" and old province \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\"\n\nNext, I noted that resolution `60-NQ/TW` confirms the province name \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\" is still valid, even though it now includes what was formerly Bình Phước. Critically, this resolution also confirmed the elimination of district-level administration.\n\nThen, I went hunting for mentions of \"Phú Cường\" within these resolutions, focusing on the Đồng Nai context.  I started with `1656/NQ-UBTVQH15`, but quickly realized these were matches for Phú Cường in Hà Nội.  Same story with `1658/NQ-UBTVQH15` from Bắc Ninh.\n\nI struck gold with `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Đồng Nai). Line 16 mentioned merging \"Phú Cường\" with \"Gia Tân 1, Gia Tân 2, and Phú Túc\" to form \"Xã Thống Nhất\".  Line 29 from the same resolution dealt specifically with Định Quán, but didn't mention Phú Cường. The absence of \"Phú Cường\" in the list of unchanged communes suggested it was merged. *However*, the fact that Gia Tân 1, 2 and Phú Túc were historically in Thống Nhất district created an ambiguity, since my input said Định Quán.\n\nI thoroughly checked the other resolutions for Phú Cường mentions in other provinces (`1663` to `1685`), finding only irrelevant matches (e.g., Phú Cường in Đồng Tháp, Hưng Yên, Phú Thọ, Thái Nguyên, and Hồ Chí Minh).\n\nComing back to the critical `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15`, Line 16 in Đồng Nai. *This is where I hit my main point of uncertainty.*  The input specifies \"Huyện Định Quán,\" yet the resolution seemed to imply a merge *into* something historically associated with Thống Nhất district. This suggests two possibilities: either the resolution is slightly inaccurate in that regard, with the old district lines becoming less relevant under the new administrative structure, or perhaps the \"Phú Cường\" from Định Quán was somehow merged into the \"Thống Nhất\" process along with the other communes. Given this, I needed to check against a list of new wards for \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\". I confirmed that the list included both \"Xã Thống Nhất\" with code 26299 and \"Xã Định Quán\" with code 26206.\n\nFrom this list and `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15`, it seemed like Phú Cường (likely the one from Thống Nhất district) was likely merged into Thống Nhất. The Định Quán resolution did not list the \"Phú Cường\" of the input, making it unlikely that it was merged to become Định Quán.\n\n*My key conclusion is that line 16 of `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15` is the best indicator.* While the district context creates some confusion, it's the only direct merging of a \"xã Phú Cường\" that I found. As such, the most probable result is that, regardless of its original district, the old \"Xã Phú Cường\" is now \"Xã Thống Nhất\" - and I'll mark that with a *low* confidence level because of that district-related ambiguity.\n",

First, I confirmed that the province name, Đồng Nai, is still valid based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW regarding the merger with Bình Phước. I then systematically checked various resolutions to see if I could find a mention of \\\"Xã Phú Cường\\\" within Đồng Nai.\\n\\nMy search turned up several resolutions, but only one, 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, from Đồng Nai itself, seemed relevant. Line 16 of this resolution states that Xã Phú Cường, along with Gia Tân 1, Gia Tân 2, and Phú Túc, were merged to form a new ward named Xã Thống Nhất.  A key detail here is that the resolution *doesn't* explicitly state the district of this specific \\\"Phú Cường.\\\" However, I did note line 89, which lists wards *not* undergoing changes. Since Phú Cường isn't on that list, this confirms that it has indeed been modified.\\n\\nWhile I can't definitively conclude that the \\\"Phú Cường\\\" in line 16 is the *same* Phú Cường from Định Quán District, the merging of units within the province is the most promising lead. Given the absence of other viable options, and the context of administrative reorganizations within Đồng Nai, I'm leaning towards *Xã Thống Nhất* being the likely new administrative unit for the former Xã Phú Cường, Huyện Định Quán, Tỉnh Đồng Nai, *pending further confirmation.* This requires further investigation to ensure absolute certainty. It is important to note the resolution only states the re-configuration of Phú Cường and the input specifically asks for information regarding Phú Cường's district.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1662/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đồng Nai\",\n        \"line\": \"16.

First, the address breaks down as \\\\\\\"Ward: Phú Cường,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"District: Định Quán,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Province: Đồng Nai.\\\\\\\" I know I need to consult relevant resolutions. My initial check of the \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất\\\\\\\" section just confirms that Đồng Nai is still Đồng Nai, although it *did* include Bình Phước at one point. This doesn't seem directly relevant, but I'll keep it in mind.\\\\n\\\\nI've been scanning resolutions for any mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cường.\\\\\\\"  I've found several, but most are in the wrong provinces - Hà Nội, Bắc Ninh, Đồng Tháp, Hưng Yên, Phú Thọ, Thái Nguyên.  Ignoring those, my focus is now on the Đồng Nai resolution: 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\\\n\\\\nLine 16 of resolution 1662 is key: It says that \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cường\\\\\\\" was merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Thống Nhất\\\\\\\". But, here's the catch: the resolution *doesn't* explicitly state the district of this \\\\\\\"Phú Cường.\\\\\\\" It doesn't clarify whether this is *my* \\\\\\\"Phú Cường\\\\\\\" in Định Quán.\\\\n\\\\nThen, line 29 deals with restructuring units, but doesn't mention \\\\\\\"Phú Cường.\\\\\\\" That's not helpful.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, line 89 is crucial: It lists the units *not* rearranged. My \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cường\\\\\\\" isn't there, so that implies it *was* rearranged. The fact that the line does include mention of Định Quán is confirmation this district is mentioned in the context of this resolution.\\\\n\\\\nSo, in summary: I'm confident that the answer lies within this Đồng Nai resolution 1662.  \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cường\\\\\\\" *was* merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Thống Nhất.\\\\\\\" My next task is to carefully verify whether this specific resolution concerns the \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cường\\\\\\\" in Định Quán or a different one.

This means I need to sift through all the relevant resolutions and data on ward changes. First, I've identified the starting point: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and specifically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Định Quán\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI started with the province-level adjustments. Resolution 60-NQ/TW doesn't impact Đồng Nai; it remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". That's straightforward. Now, the real work begins with the specific ward changes. I've examined resolutions from the relevant region. 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 don't relate to our region.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key seems to be in resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Đồng Nai). It explicitly states a change affecting \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Specifically, clause 16 mentions combining \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with several other units to create a new ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thống Nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, it doesn't explicitly state \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường (huyện Định Quán)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, given the context of the resolution being for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and the fact that other resolutions don't reference \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within Đồng Nai, it's highly probable that this is the correct \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Clause 29 outlines another ward name, so it's irrelevant. Clause 89 states 95 entities, it does not mention our ward of interest.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nAfter cross-referencing this information, I can assert that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Cường, Huyện Định Quán, Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is most likely now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thống Nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  This seems to be the most logical conclusion given the available data, despite the lack of direct specificity in the resolution.

Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Đồng Nai remains Đồng Nai, so that's straightforward. Now, the real work begins with the specific resolutions concerning ward-level adjustments.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI'm scanning through the resolutions, focusing on any mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within Đồng Nai.  I quickly see that Resolutions 1656, 1658, 1663, 1666, 1676, 1683, and 1685 are irrelevant because they address other provinces.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nResolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, however, catches my eye.

Clause 16 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the context of creating a new ward called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thống Nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The wording isn't perfectly clear - it doesn't explicitly state \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường (huyện Định Quán)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - but given the context of the resolution being for Đồng Nai, and given that there are no other obvious \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Cường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"s in Đồng Nai, I'm fairly certain this is the one.
