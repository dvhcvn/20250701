  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for Phường Bửu Hòa**\n\nAlright, let's break this down systematically. The question is straightforward: what's the updated administrative unit for \"Phường Bửu Hòa, Thành phố Biên Hòa, Tỉnh Đồng Nai\"? As an expert, I'm already thinking about the key resources I'll need: the relevant resolutions and the new ward data.\n\nFirst, I had to confirm that Đồng Nai remained Đồng Nai, and sure enough, Resolution 60-NQ/TW clarified that while it absorbed Bình Phước, its core identity remained the same. This keeps things simple.\n\nNow, the main focus is Resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, the real meat of the matter.  I quickly zeroed in on the specifics for Đồng Nai. Line 68 is key: it explicitly states that **\"Phường Bửu Hòa\" is merging into a new ward called \"Phường Biên Hòa.\"**  Perfect. That's a direct hit. There was no need to look at any other information as to what happened to Phường Bửu Hòa.\n\nJust to be thorough, I verified that other areas, such as Long Bình Tân, An Hòa, and Long Hưng, were NOT involved, which confirms my initial findings that no other areas were impacted.\n\nFinally, I cross-referenced the new ward data to ensure the resolution was fully implemented. I found the entry for \"Phường Biên Hòa\" with the correct ward code and, importantly, the confirmed \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\" province. This matching seals the deal; the province is the same, and the merger is official.\n\nIn essence, \"Phường Bửu Hòa\" has been absorbed into \"Phường Biên Hòa\". The evidence is robust, direct, and conclusive. I'm completely confident in this assessment. This is a straightforward administrative re-organization, and my analysis confirms the precise outcome.\n",
