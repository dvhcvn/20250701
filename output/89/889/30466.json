  "thought": "**Analyzing the Administrative Restructuring of \"Xã Khánh Hòa, Huyện Châu Phú, Tỉnh An Giang\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking for the new administrative unit corresponding to the old address \"Xã Khánh Hòa, Huyện Châu Phú, Tỉnh An Giang\". The first thing I did was confirm the province and ward: An Giang and Xã Khánh Hòa, respectively.  Then, I double-checked for any provincial mergers.  Thankfully, An Giang remained An Giang after reviewing the relevant resolutions (60-NQ/TW).\n\nThe crucial step was going through the ward resolutions for \"Tỉnh An Giang\". I zeroed in on Resolution 1654/NQ-UBTVQH15, where I found the answer in line 16.  It clearly stated that \"Xã Khánh Hòa\" was *merged* with \"Xã Mỹ Đức\" to form a new ward, still within the province of An Giang.  I immediately cross-referenced this with my \"New wards\" data and, sure enough, I found \"Xã Mỹ Đức\" with the correct ward code.\n\nTo ensure there was no ambiguity, I had to be thorough. I went through *all* the other resolutions concerning wards with the name \"Khánh Hòa\", just to make sure I wasn't missing anything. There were references to \"Khánh Hòa\" in Cà Mau, Cần Thơ, Lào Cai, and Ninh Bình, but those all pertained to their own provinces and had different outcomes. The *only* relevant information for the specific location I was interested in was the merger into \"Xã Mỹ Đức\" in Resolution 1654/NQ-UBTVQH15.\n\nTherefore, with complete confidence, I can conclude that the old \"Xã Khánh Hòa\" in An Giang is now part of the new ward, \"Xã Mỹ Đức\", and the corresponding code is 30469. This is a very straightforward and clear-cut case of administrative restructuring.\n",
