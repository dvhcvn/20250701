  "thought": "**Address Mapping Analysis: Vietnamese Administrative Unit Transformation**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with mapping this old Vietnamese address to its current administrative structure, and it looks like a straightforward spatial analysis. The initial address gives me \"Xã Bình Phước Xuân\" as the ward, \"Huyện Chợ Mới\" as the district, and \"Tỉnh An Giang\" as the province.\n\nThe user mentions \"eliminating all districts,\" so I'll keep that in mind. The focus is definitely on wards and provinces, based on the input.\n\nMy first step is to check if there are any province-level changes. Resolution 60-NQ/TW doesn't indicate any province mergers or dissolutions for An Giang. So, the province, for all intents and purposes, remains \"Tỉnh An Giang.\" This is good, it simplifies things.\n\nNow, to nail down the ward, I need to look into resolutions concerning ward-level changes within An Giang. I've found resolution 1654/NQ-UBTVQH15, which is exactly what I'm looking for: it deals with the reorganization of wards in An Giang. I'm carefully going through the list. Bingo! Line 33 of that resolution explicitly mentions \"Xã Bình Phước Xuân.\" It states that \"Xã Bình Phước Xuân\" is merged with a few other wards to form the new ward called \"Xã Cù Lao Giêng.\"\n\nThat's the key. Now, I have the new ward name. I'll take a look at the provided \"New wards\" data. I'm looking for a match with \"Xã Cù Lao Giêng.\" The data lists \"Xã Cù Lao Giêng\" with a `ward_code` of \"30643\" and confirms \"Tỉnh An Giang\" as the province. This is perfect.\n\nSo, the new administrative unit for \"Xã Bình Phước Xuân\" is now \"Xã Cù Lao Giêng\" within \"Tỉnh An Giang,\" and I have the resolution citation to back it up. I'd confidently label this with a \"high\" confidence level because it's a direct and explicit mapping within the resolution. Therefore, I can output the following JSON with confidence!\n",
