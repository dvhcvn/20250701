  "thought": "**Address Mapping Analysis: Xã Lạc Quới**\n\nOkay, so I've got this old Vietnamese address, \"Xã Lạc Quới,\" and I need to figure out its current equivalent based on these resolutions and the new ward data.  Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I identified the components of the old address:  \"Xã Lạc Quới\" (ward), \"Huyện Tri Tôn\" (district - which, as per the instructions, I'm noting but ignoring for the final output), and \"Tỉnh An Giang\" (province).  Now, the real work begins.\n\nMy initial thought was to check for any province-level changes.  I examined the province resolutions (60-NQ/TW), specifically looking for \"Tỉnh An Giang\" in both the \"do not change\" and the \"post-merger/consolidation\" lists.  An Giang wasn't in the \"do not change\" list, but in the \"post-merger\" section, I saw it, along with a note about its merging with Kiên Giang.  Crucially, it mentions that the name *remains* \"Tỉnh An Giang\".\n\nNext, I delved into the \"Other resolutions\", focusing on any mention of \"Xã Lạc Quới.\"  Bingo!  Resolution 1654/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically line 22, was the key.  It unequivocally states that \"Xã Lạc Quới\" *and* other units will be merged into a new ward called \"Xã Ba Chúc\".  That's my primary candidate.\n\nNow, to confirm, I cross-referenced this with the \"New wards\" data.  Sure enough, I found \"Xã Ba Chúc\" listed, complete with its ward code and province confirmation, solidifying the match.  Excellent.\n\nI then constructed the JSON output.  The province name is straightforward: \"Tỉnh An Giang\" (unchanged).  The new ward is clearly \"Xã Ba Chúc,\" with its corresponding code. The `citation` will accurately point to the relevant resolution and the specific line where the merge is described. The `confidence` level here is \"high\", as the mapping is explicit and well-supported by the data.\n\nI did quickly consider any edge cases: are there other relevant resolutions, or are there other ward candidates. I scanned but came up empty, reinforcing my conclusion. This one seems pretty clear-cut, there is only one clear new ward based on the information provided.\n",
