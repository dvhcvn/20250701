  "thought": "**Deconstructing an Old Vietnamese Address for Modern Mapping**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to accurately map that old Vietnamese address, \"Xã An Tức, Huyện Tri Tôn, Tỉnh An Giang,\" to its current administrative equivalents. I've got the data – resolutions and ward information – and now it's time to put it all together.\n\nFirst, I recognized \"Tỉnh An Giang\" as the old province. A quick check of Resolution 60-NQ/TW confirmed that An Giang remains, though there were some mergers, but not of An Giang itself. That's a good starting point.\n\nNext, I need to pinpoint \"Xã An Tức,\" the old ward. Delving into the resolutions, I found the key in resolution `1654/NQ-UBTVQH15`. Line 24 in that resolution is gold: it states that the areas and populations of \"Xã An Tức\", \"Lương Phi\", and \"Ô Lâm\" were merged into a new \"Xã Ô Lâm.\" Boom! That's the link I was looking for.\n\nNow, I'll cross-reference that resolution with my new ward data. I located the entry for \"Xã Ô Lâm\" and pulled its `ward_code` (which will be essential for the final JSON output) and the `province_name`, confirming that it still falls within \"Tỉnh An Giang.\"\n\nFinally, I'll structure the output. I'll include the relevant citation from the resolution. I'm feeling confident about this match, as the resolution explicitly outlines the ward change, so the confidence level will be \"high.\" The `province_name` will be the new name, \"Tỉnh An Giang.\" I'll then grab the `ward_code` for \"Xã Ô Lâm\" and the `ward_name` itself. Essentially, using the information to create a very clean and accurate mapping.\n",
