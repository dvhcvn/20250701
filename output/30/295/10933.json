The user needs to know what happened to the old ward \"Xã Phúc Điền, Huyện Cẩm Giàng, Tỉnh Hải Dương.\"  My first step was to break down the request: old ward name, old district name, old province name.  Easy enough.  Next, I had to figure out the current provincial context.  Based on the provided resolutions, I ascertained that \"Tỉnh Hải Dương\" was merged into \"thành phố Hải Phòng.\" This is key. Any new administrative units must reside within Hải Phòng.\n\nI then systematically went through the relevant resolutions. I quickly eliminated the ones that didn't apply (Hà Nội, Tây Ninh, Thái Nguyên, and Thanh Hóa). Resolution 1669/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Hải Phòng) was the big one. I carefully analyzed its lines.  Line 81 explicitly states that part of \"Xã Phúc Điền\" was merged into the new \"xã Mao Điền.\"  Then, Line 82 confirmed that the *remaining* part of \"Xã Phúc Điền\" was merged with other wards into \"xã Cẩm Giàng\".\n\nTherefore, I can confidently state that based on Resolution 1669/NQ-UBTVQH15, the old \"Xã Phúc Điền\" is now divided between two new administrative units within the \"thành phố Hải Phòng\": \"xã Mao Điền\" and \"xã Cẩm Giàng\". The breakdown is as follows: A part of the old ward is now a part of \"xã Mao Điền\". The remaining part of the old ward, after the previous merging, is now a part of \"xã Cẩm Giàng\". The analysis is complete.\n",

The user's looking for the updated administrative location for the old address \\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền, Huyện Cẩm Giàng, Tỉnh Hải Dương\\\\\\\". My process starts with a province check. I immediately knew to consult `60-NQ/TW` to see if \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hải Dương\\\\\\\" had undergone any administrative changes. Sure enough, there was a merger, changing the province from \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hải Dương\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nNext, I turned my attention to finding \\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\" in the relevant resolutions under \\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\". Resolution `1669/NQ-UBTVQH15` was the key. Scrutinizing the details, specifically lines 81 and 82, I discovered that \\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\" was actually split between two new units: \\\\\\\"xã Mao Điền\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Cẩm Giàng\\\\\\\". Line 81 indicates that part of the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\" went to create \\\\\\\"xã Mao Điền\\\\\\\", while the remaining portion, as per line 82, was merged into \\\\\\\"xã Cẩm Giàng\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nTo solidify my findings, I cross-referenced this with the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" data. I confirmed the ward codes and province names for \\\\\\\"xã Mao Điền\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Cẩm Giàng\\\\\\\" there. Interestingly, I also saw \\\\\\\"Xã Cẩm Giang\\\\\\\" in line 83, but that's a different restructuring not related to \\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nHere's the tricky part: Since the original address only states \\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\", I can't definitively determine *which* portion of the old ward the user is interested in. Therefore, while both \\\\\\\"Xã Mao Điền\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Cẩm Giàng\\\\\\\" are possible new addresses, the confidence in the result is low. Without more information about the specific part of the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\" the user is interested in, a precise answer is not possible.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hải Dương và thành phố Hải Phòng, lấy tên là thành phố Hải Phòng\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"10930\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Mao Điền\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hải Dương và thành phố Hải Phòng, lấy tên là thành phố Hải Phòng\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"10903\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Cẩm Giàng\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền, Huyện Cẩm Giàng, Tỉnh Hải Dương\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 7541,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0028916999999999997,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Navigating the Administrative Unit Restructuring of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tasked with pinpointing the new administrative unit(s) corresponding to the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền, Huyện Cẩm Giàng, Tỉnh Hải Dương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". My initial approach is logical and aligns with my expertise in this domain. First, I need to address the province, checking for any mergers or name changes. I quickly consulted `60-NQ/TW` and confirmed that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hải Dương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" due to a merger with Hải Phòng city.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I zeroed in on the relevant resolutions for this new province. Specifically, I'm focusing on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and found `1669/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  After carefully scrutinizing this document, line 81 stood out. It clearly states that a portion of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was restructured, merging with other units to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Mao Điền\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Further down, in line 82, I see that the *remaining* portion of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" contributed to the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Cẩm Giàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, I'm confident that these are the two potential new wards. To solidify this, I then cross-referenced these findings with my `New wards` data to obtain the corresponding `ward_code` and confirm the `province_name`.  I have entries for both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mao Điền\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cẩm Giàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which validates the restructuring.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, a critical point emerges here. Since the original address only gives the broad \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phúc Điền,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" without specifying which *part* of it, I can't definitively determine if the address refers to the portion that went to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Mao Điền\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or the portion that became \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Cẩm Giàng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Therefore, while both are candidates, the confidence level must remain \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I can identify the *possible* new units, but not the *exact* one based on the given incomplete information. This level of detail is crucial in this type of assessment.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hải Dương và thành phố Hải Phòng, lấy tên là thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"10930\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Mao Điền\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hải Dương và thành phố Hải Phòng, lấy tên là thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"10903\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Cẩm Giàng\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ]\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
