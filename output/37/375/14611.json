  "thought": "**Analyzing the Vietnamese Address \"Xã Khánh Nhạc\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user's goal is clear: they need to map this old address, \"Xã Khánh Nhạc\" in Yên Khánh District, Ninh Bình Province, to the current administrative structure. My approach is methodical, leveraging my knowledge of these datasets and administrative resolutions.\n\nFirst, I identified the components: \"Xã Khánh Nhạc\" (the old ward), \"Huyện Yên Khánh\" (the old district), and \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\" (the old province). While districts are often reorganized, knowing the old district helps in context.\n\nI dove into the province resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW). The goal here was to see if Ninh Bình's boundaries had changed. Thankfully, the resolution clarified that Ninh Bình remained Ninh Bình after a merger with other provinces, so that was straightforward.\n\nThen came the crucial step: checking other relevant resolutions (specifically 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15). I zeroed in on lines that mentioned \"Xã Khánh Nhạc.\" Bingo! Line 82 of 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15 was explicit. It stated that \"Xã Khánh Nhạc\" and \"Xã Khánh Hồng\" were merged to form a *new* \"Xã Khánh Nhạc\". This is key: it's a restructuring, not a complete disappearance.\n\nNext, I cross-referenced this resolution finding with the `New wards` data. I searched for \"Xã Khánh Nhạc\" and, sure enough, I found a match: a new ward also named \"Xã Khánh Nhạc\" within Ninh Bình Province. The ward code matched.\n\nBased on the explicit mention in the resolution, and the confirmed entry in the `New wards` data, I have high confidence in this mapping. \"Xã Khánh Nhạc\" is confirmed to exist today in Ninh Bình Province, but as a result of a merger with Khánh Hồng. This merger resulted in a new ward that took the same name.\n\nTherefore, the output will be based on 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 82. My confidence is high, and I can confidently provide the ward name and code. I will include the citation, the ward name, ward code and the province name in the JSON output, along with the high confidence level.\n",
