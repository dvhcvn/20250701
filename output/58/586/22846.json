  "thought": "**Analyzing the Administrative Restructuring of Vĩnh Hải**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out where \"Xã Vĩnh Hải, Huyện Ninh Hải, Tỉnh Ninh Thuận\" ended up.  First, the obvious: Ninh Thuận merged with Khánh Hòa, so I'm looking within Khánh Hòa now. My process is always the same: check the relevant resolutions and look for any mentions of the original names and the province.\n\nSo, I've got this: a \"Xã Vĩnh Hải\" in \"Huyện Ninh Hải\" from \"Tỉnh Ninh Thuận\". This needs to have its new location identified.\n\nI started with Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW), knowing Ninh Thuận and Khánh Hòa were combined. Bingo - now it's Khánh Hòa.\n\nNow, I'm digging into the resolutions (1667/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1669/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15) looking for clues:\n\n*   **Resolution 1667 (Khánh Hòa):** Looks promising.  There's a lot of activity here.  Bingo again! There are mentions of the old \"Xã Vĩnh Hải\" being transformed into \"Xã Vĩnh Hải\". The old district was \"Huyện Ninh Hải\".  This is a good sign. There's also a mention of a \"phường Vĩnh Hải\" merging into \"phường Bắc Nha Trang\", but that's a *phường* and my source unit is a *xã*. This means I need to be more careful here and make sure that this is the correct Vĩnh Hải. Line 39 in this resolution seems like a perfect match: \"... các xã Nhơn Hải, Thanh Hải và Vĩnh Hải thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Vĩnh Hải**.\" This is probably the one I need.\n\n*   The other Resolutions: I quickly scanned the other resolutions.  Lots of other \"Vĩnh Hải\" and \"Ninh Hải\" mentions, but they are in the wrong provinces (Cần Thơ, Hải Phòng, Ninh Bình, Thanh Hóa).\n\n**Conclusion:** I'm pretty confident that the \"Xã Vĩnh Hải\" I'm looking for is now part of the new \"Xã Vĩnh Hải\" in Khánh Hòa as per resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15. However, I have a slight concern about the lack of any mentioning of \"Huyện Ninh Hải\" explicitly in the final name of the new unit. I should double-check and compare data from the previous resolution with this newly formed unit, because I still need a confirmation about this new \"Xã Vĩnh Hải\" being the correct one.\n",

Then, I knew I had to check provincial resolutions (60-NQ/TW) to understand any potential merges. I found that Ninh Thuận merged with Khánh Hòa, becoming \\\"Tỉnh Khánh Hoà\\\". This is *crucial* - any matches must now be within Khánh Hòa.\\n\\nNext, I thoroughly analyzed several resolutions looking for mentions of \\\"Vĩnh Hải\\\" or \\\"Ninh Hải\\\" within Khánh Hòa. Resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically, caught my attention. It was the correct province, Khánh Hòa! It described the restructuring of several wards. I had to pay close attention because the names are so similar:\\n\\n*   I saw a new \\\"xã Ninh Hải\\\", interesting because the old district was \\\"Huyện Ninh Hải\\\".\\n*   Most importantly, I saw that a new \\\"xã Vĩnh Hải\\\" was formed by combining \\\"Nhơn Hải,\\\" \\\"Thanh Hải,\\\" and \\\"Vĩnh Hải.\\\"  This is a strong candidate, but the original district is not mentioned explicitly. I needed more context.\\n*   There was a mention of \\\"phường Vĩnh Hải\\\" merging into a new \\\"phường Bắc Nha Trang\\\". However, this is a *phường* and not a *xã*. So, this is less likely to be relevant.\\n*   Another section mentions a \\\"phường Ninh Hải\\\" being merged into a new \\\"phường Đông Ninh Hòa\\\". Also, it's not a match, as it references a *phường* and the old address has a *huyện*.\\n\\nI checked other resolutions (1668, 1669, 1674, and 1686) but they all dealt with unrelated provinces. Therefore, they are irrelevant.\\n\\nSynthesizing my findings, I concluded that since Ninh Thuận became part of Khánh Hòa, and the original address was \\\"Xã Vĩnh Hải, Huyện Ninh Hải\\\", the best match is most likely with Resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15. Specifically, the part describing how a new \\\"xã Vĩnh Hải\\\" was formed by the merging of wards \\\"Nhơn Hải\\\", \\\"Thanh Hải\\\", and \\\"Vĩnh Hải.\\\"  This is the most relevant change based on the information provided.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1667/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Khánh Hòa\",\n        \"line\": \"39.

I need to check the relevant resolutions, particularly 60-NQ/TW, to confirm this.  \\\\n\\\\nAh, yes,  resolution 60-NQ/TW clearly states that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Ninh Thuận\\\\\\\" was merged with \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Khánh Hoà\\\\\\\" to form a single entity, now known as \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Khánh Hoà.\\\\\\\"  This is a critical piece of information.

My initial strategy is to break this down into digestible steps. First, I need to understand that the province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Ninh Thuận,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been restructured. The resolution (specifically, 60-NQ/TW) states it merged with Khánh Hoà, becoming \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Khánh Hoà.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This means I'm now searching within the boundaries of Khánh Hoà, not Ninh Thuận.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I zero in on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Hải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Now, comes the interesting part – cross-referencing this old ward with the restructuring resolutions to determine its current status. I'm focusing on those specific resolutions. I found two related and relevant resolutions: 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15, and 1669/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResolution 1667 deals with Khánh Hòa. In its section, I've found multiple mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vĩnh Hải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" One clause states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"các xã Nhơn Hải, Thanh Hải và Vĩnh Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would form a new commune called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vĩnh Hải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Moreover, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Vĩnh Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vĩnh Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are listed in a clause discussing the formation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Bắc Nha Trang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This resolution indicates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vĩnh Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is involved in administrative changes. Resolution 1669/NQ-UBTVQH15 mentions Xã Vĩnh Hải in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Hải Phòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but it is not relevant to my task.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn conclusion, resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 is the important one for this case. However, more precise information on the location within the Ninh Thuận area is needed to determine the exact relationship. It implies \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" may be within the newly formed Vĩnh Hải Commune or the new Bắc Nha Trang district.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"13.
