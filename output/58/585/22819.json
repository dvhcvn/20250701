  "thought": "**Processing the Request to Map the Old Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thought process: The user needs me to figure out the new location of \"Xã Quảng Sơn, Huyện Ninh Sơn, Tỉnh Ninh Thuận\" based on a set of resolutions.  First, I needed to understand the request and output format – a JSON array with ward information.  Then, I started analyzing the given information.\n\nFirst, I looked at what happened to the province. I found out that \"Tỉnh Ninh Thuận\" merged with \"Khánh Hoà\" based on the \"60-NQ/TW\" resolution. So, I knew that the old ward now resides within \"Khánh Hoà.\"\n\nNext, I examined the other resolutions. I specifically focused on those related to Khánh Hoà because of the province merger. Resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 jumped out. It directly mentioned \"xã Quảng Sơn\" being merged to create \"xã Ninh Sơn.\" Line 42 was the key.\n\nThen I checked the new ward data, and yes, there was an entry: `{\"ward_code\":\"22810\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ninh Sơn\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa\"}`. This was a perfect match.\n\nCombining the province merger and the specific ward-level resolution, the confidence level is \"high.\" The only logical output is \"Xã Ninh Sơn.\" The fact that the resolution creates a ward called \"Xã Ninh Sơn\" in Khánh Hòa from the same area, with the same commune name and in the same province that \"Ninh Thuận\" was merged into, is the only possible output. The old \"Xã Quảng Sơn\" from Ninh Thuận has now become \"Xã Ninh Sơn.\"\nThe citation I will use is the key resolution: 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 with the specific line 42 as the main evidence because it directly maps the old ward to the new.\n",
