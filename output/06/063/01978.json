  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Transformation**\n\nMy thought process is focused on determining the new administrative unit for \"Xã Sĩ Bình, Huyện Bạch Thông, Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\". The first step is clear: I need to identify the new province and ward.\n\nI began by analyzing the given information: the old ward (\"Xã Sĩ Bình\"), district (\"Huyện Bạch Thông\"), and province (\"Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\"). I know that Tỉnh Bắc Kạn was part of a province merger, so I referenced Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which confirmed the formation of \"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\" from the merger of Tỉnh Bắc Kạn and Tỉnh Thái Nguyên.  This established the new province.\n\nNext, I looked for information regarding the old district, \"Huyện Bạch Thông\". Resolution 1683/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning administrative re-organization within Tỉnh Thái Nguyên, caught my eye.  Line 63 of this resolution detailed the creation of a new ward, \"Xã Bạch Thông\".  However, the cited line only mentioned the merging of \"Đồng Thắng, Dương Phong, and Quang Thuận\" to form \"Xã Bạch Thông\".  Critically, my original ward, \"Xã Sĩ Bình\", was *not* explicitly mentioned.\n\nI then consulted the new ward database, which confirmed the existence of \"Xã Bạch Thông\" in Tỉnh Thái Nguyên, with the code \"02014\".\n\nSynthesizing this information presents a challenge. The fact that the old district name, \"Huyện Bạch Thông\", mirrors the new ward name, \"Xã Bạch Thông\", is a strong indicator. It is highly probable that the new ward was formed, at least partially, from the old Huyện Bạch Thông. However, since the resolution *doesn't* specifically include \"Xã Sĩ Bình\" as one of the merged wards, it introduces some uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, my final judgment will be:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\",\n    \"ward_name\": \"Xã Bạch Thông\",\n    \"ward_code\": \"02014\",\n    \"confidence\": \"low\",\n    \"citation\": {\n      \"header\": \"1683/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Thái Nguyên\",\n      \"line\": \"63. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Đồng Thắng, Dương Phong và Quang Thuận thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Bạch Thông**.\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nAlthough the evidence suggests a strong probability, due to the explicit absence of \"Xã Sĩ Bình\" in the resolution, I need to express this with \"low\" confidence.\n",

I need to figure out where \\\"Xã Sĩ Bình, Huyện Bạch Thông, Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\" ended up in the new administrative structure based on the provided resolutions.  It's a bit of a puzzle!\\n\\nFirst, the user has given me the old address, and the task is to pinpoint its new location, fully or partially, and present it as a JSON array.  I've got the province level resolution `60-NQ/TW` and `1683/NQ-UBTVQH15` covering Thái Nguyên.  I also have a list of new wards.\\n\\nMy initial thought is to tackle this step by step. I'll need to figure out what happened to \\\"Bắc Kạn\\\" province. Then I have to consider the fate of the district and commune levels. I know that according to the user, districts are being eliminated in the restructuring.\\n\\nI looked at Resolution `60-NQ/TW` and found that Bắc Kạn merged with Thái Nguyên. That's a good start.  Next, I focused on the specific resolution relating to Thái Nguyên, `1683/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  This is where the real work begins. I need to check if the old unit \\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\" is mentioned in this document. Unfortunately, it's not. I scanned the lines and came across a new ward named \\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\". It's a key observation, but it's formed from merging \\\"Đồng Thắng, Dương Phong and Quang Thuận\\\".  I note that the old district had a similar name. However, nothing confirms that \\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\" went into this new ward.\\n\\nThis is tricky.  I have a strong inclination that the \\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\" from the \\\"New Wards List\\\" is the most likely candidate, considering the name similarity. Administrative reforms often use that strategy. However, the provided data doesn't explicitly link \\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\" to the new \\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\" ward. The resolutions are incomplete. I'm missing some crucial pieces of information.\\n\\nTherefore, although \\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\" *could* be the destination, I'm lacking concrete evidence. The confidence level must be \\\"low.\\\" Based on the evidence at hand, my best guess is to map to the new \\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\" in Thái Nguyên. And, as there isn't a direct citation, I can't cite the resolution.\\n\\nFinally, I'll need to format the information into the required JSON output.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"02014\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Bạch Thông\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Sĩ Bình, Huyện Bạch Thông, Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 19423,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0035242000000000003,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Processing the Mapping Request for \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\"**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants me to find the new location for \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình, Huyện Bạch Thông, Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\\\\\" based on some provided resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the scope. I know this is about administrative unit changes, and I'm dealing with merging, renaming, and re-zoning at the province and commune levels. I'm provided with the province-level changes (specifically resolution 60-NQ/TW) and a ward/commune-level resolution (1683/NQ-UBTVQH15) for Thái Nguyên. I also have a list of the new wards. My task is to produce a JSON array following a strict format, indicating my confidence level and citing my sources.\\\\n\\\\nNow, step by step:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Province-Level Analysis:** \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\\\\\" is gone; 60-NQ/TW states it was merged with \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\\\\\\\". So, \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\" is now located *somewhere* in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n2.  **District and Commune Breakdown:** I've been told districts have been eliminated. \\\\\\\"Huyện Bạch Thông\\\\\\\" is no more. I'm focusing on \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\" itself.\\\\n\\\\n3.  **Resolution Search:** I check resolution 1683/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Thái Nguyên. The resolution mentions a new commune called \\\\\\\"xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\". It's a key clue! However, it specifies that \\\\\\\"xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\" was formed by combining \\\\\\\"Đồng Thắng, Dương Phong and Quang Thuận\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\" isn't listed.\\\\n\\\\n4.  **Synthesizing and Mapping:** I have a bit of a dilemma here. I can't definitively say \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\" is part of the new \\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\" based solely on the provided resolutions. The name similarity between the old district and the new commune *is* suggestive; it's a common practice. But, this particular resolution doesn't confirm the merger. The given information simply doesn't cover all the changes, so \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\" might now be part of another, unmentioned new ward.\\\\n\\\\n5.  **Output:** So, my JSON will reflect low confidence because the evidence is circumstantial. I'll include the new \\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\" as a possible candidate, based on the name similarity, but I can't cite 1683/NQ-UBTVQH15 because it doesn't mention \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\". It looks like additional resolutions might be required to give a definite answer.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"02014\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình, Huyện Bạch Thông, Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 16389,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0030792000000000003,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Deconstructing and Analyzing the Vietnamese Address Mapping Request**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, I've got a Vietnamese address to map from old to new, and I'm diving in. The user wants to map `Xã Sĩ Bình, Huyện Bạch Thông, Tỉnh Bắc Kạn` to its current location, using a set of resolutions.  Here's my thought process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**1. Input and Context:**  I've got the old address: `Xã Sĩ Bình, Huyện Bạch Thông, Tỉnh Bắc Kạn`.  The context is a collection of resolutions.  There's `60-NQ/TW` for provincial changes and a set of other resolutions, including `1683/NQ-UBTVQH15` about `Tỉnh Thái Nguyên`.  The user has provided a JSON schema for the output.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**2.  Dissecting the Problem:**  First, I've got to break this down.  I need to identify which provinces have changed based on `60-NQ/TW`.  Then, I'll need to see if any of the ward-level changes relate to my input address.  Specifically, I'm looking for the old `Xã Sĩ Bình` or `Huyện Bạch Thông` in the provided resolutions.  I'll need to figure out the corresponding new ward and district, and then output it in that JSON format.  I'll also flag the confidence level (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") and cite the resolution line if I use one.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**3.  The Provincial Step:** I'm starting with the provincial change. I'll search `60-NQ/TW` for `Tỉnh Bắc Kạn`.  It clearly states that `Tỉnh Bắc Kạn` merged with `Tỉnh Thái Nguyên` to form `Tỉnh Thái Nguyên`.  That's straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**4. The Ward Puzzle:** Now, onto the ward-level changes.  Since the province is now `Thái Nguyên`, I'm focusing on the resolutions for that province. The relevant document is `1683/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  I'm looking for mentions of `Xã Sĩ Bình` or `Huyện Bạch Thông`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe crucial line in `1683/NQ-UBTVQH15` details: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Đồng Thắng, Dương Phong và Quang Thuận thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Bạch Thông**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Aha!  The new ward is named `Xã Bạch Thông`, which is derived from `Huyện Bạch Thông` in my input.  This is a significant clue.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, the resolution line only mentions `Đồng Thắng, Dương Phong and Quang Thuận`.  My target ward is `Xã Sĩ Bình`. It's possible that other wards from `Huyện Bạch Thông` may be merged into the new `Xã Bạch Thông`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**5.  Assessing the Situation:**  The province mapping is solid - it's a high confidence level that `Bắc Kạn` is now part of `Thái Nguyên`.  But the ward mapping is tricky. While the new ward's name links to the old district, and it's in the right province, `Xã Sĩ Bình` isn't specifically mentioned. It's a low confidence mapping until I can confirm whether `Sĩ Bình` is also part of this new `Xã Bạch Thông`.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**6. Formatting the Output:**  I need to output the JSON, taking these factors into account.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1683/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Thái Nguyên\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"63.

The goal is to figure out the new province and ward for the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình, Huyện Bạch Thông, Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on the resolutions and data provided.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, the province is pretty straightforward. I quickly checked Resolution 60-NQ/TW and confirmed that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't appear in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"do not merge\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list. But it's clearly listed as merging with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  So, old province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" maps directly to new province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  That's a high-confidence mapping.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the ward is where it gets tricky. I went through the provided \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other Resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and found Resolution 1683/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns ward changes in Thái Nguyên.  It mentions creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by combining \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đồng Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dương Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quang Thuận\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The problem?  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *isn't* mentioned in that resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI also checked the provided new ward data, which, as expected, includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a new ward in Thái Nguyên. But again, it's the result of those *other* wards combining, not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere's the rub: because the instructions are to only use the *provided* information, and because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is conspicuously absent from the resolution that creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I have to conclude that I can't definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *using just the information given*.  The prompt specifically asks me to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"include all possible new ward candidates\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and to state my confidence level if information is lacking. The only candidate I have is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but that's a poor mapping as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is absent in this information. Therefore, I'm forced to say that, based solely on the provided resolutions and data, I have *low* confidence in being able to map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to any new ward, and that the only possible mapping is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The old address mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the new ward mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, the resolution clearly states where this mapping stems from, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't included.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"3.

Here's my thinking:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to get the province right. Based on resolution 60-NQ/TW, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Kạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't listed as staying the same. Looking further, I see that it's been *merged* with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Easy enough. My confidence here is high.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, for the ward. This is where it gets tricky. I have resolution 1683/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns ward changes in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Nguyên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This resolution creates a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from a merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đồng Thắng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Dương Phong,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quang Thuận.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But here's the kicker: **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* mentioned anywhere in this resolution.**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI also have the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data, which confirms the existence of this new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and its associated code. However, the origin of this \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" clearly comes from those three other wards, not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nEssentially, I'm stuck. I have a clear province mapping, but I *cannot* definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new ward based solely on the provided resolutions. I know the old address mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and the new ward is also \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but I need *explicit* confirmation in a resolution that the specific ward is now part of this new entity. The resolution only discusses merging those other wards.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe prompt specifically wants me to be cautious about insufficient information and indicate a low confidence. Since \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't mentioned in the ward-related resolution, and no other resolution specifically concerns it, I have to conclude that **my confidence in mapping \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sĩ Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to any new ward, based on these documents, is low.** I can confidently state the province mapping, but the ward mapping remains unknown with the current information. The provided \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bạch Thông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is relevant, but doesn't *include* the old ward, only the other merged wards. The prompt wants me to map based only on what's given.
