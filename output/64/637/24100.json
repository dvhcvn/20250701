  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, so I've got this request to map an old administrative unit, specifically `Xã Ia HDreh, Huyện Krông Pa, Tỉnh Gia Lai`, to its new designation, based on a couple of resolutions. First, I need to understand the data: I have the old unit's details, and two resolutions: `60-NQ/TW` which is about province mergers, and `1660/NQ-UBTVQH15` which seems to deal with communes in Đắk Lắk province. I also have a database of new ward information that might be relevant.\n\nMy first step is to break this down, starting at the province level using `60-NQ/TW`. The goal is to determine the fate of `Tỉnh Gia Lai`. The resolution states that Gia Lai merged with Bình Định, but retained the name Gia Lai. So, the old ward remains within the *new* Gia Lai, which is now larger. That's a good starting point, but it doesn't give me the specific ward.\n\nNext, I need to get more granular and look at the district/ward level with `1660/NQ-UBTVQH15`. The header says it's about Đắk Lắk, so I'm immediately skeptical if it'll be relevant for a ward in Gia Lai. I scan the document for any mention of my unit. It mentions that  Phú Yên merged into Đắk Lắk. So, I see that this document covers Đắk Lắk and the communes that used to be in Phú Yên.\n\nI keep looking, but nothing jumps out. I see a reference to `xã Krông Pa`, but that's a *commune* and I'm looking for the *district*, `Huyện Krông Pa`. So, it's not a direct match. The resolution, as a whole is not applicable to my case.\n\nNow, I take a step back and think about the implications. If the Vietnamese government has eliminated districts as stated in the context, `Huyện Krông Pa` must no longer exist. This means `Xã Ia HDreh` was merged or renamed. The provided resolutions *should* provide some guidance, but they don't have the key information, which is a problem. The documents I have are incomplete, and I can't determine with certainty what happened to this unit.\n\nSince I can't find anything in the provided documents to confirm, the confidence must be low. I think the best approach here is to return an empty array or a result indicating no match. The instructions seem to allow this, so I will do that. There's simply not enough information to map this unit with any degree of accuracy. The similarity in the \"Krông Pa\" name is a coincidence, but not a link, between a district in Gia Lai and a commune formerly in Phú Yên. There's no possible connection, according to the documents.\n",

  "previousResult": "{\n  \"address\": \"Xã Ia HDreh, Huyện Krông Pa, Tỉnh Gia Lai\",\n  \"ellapsedInMs\": 14101,\n  \"estimatedCost\": 0.0026628000000000003,\n  \"thought\": \"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change Request**\\n\\nOkay, I've got a tricky one here. I need to figure out the new administrative unit for \\\"Xã Ia HDreh, Huyện Krông Pa, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\". The user is likely an expert, so I need to be precise and explain my reasoning step-by-step.\\n\\nFirst, I parsed the old address. I've got a ward (\\\"Xã Ia HDreh\\\"), a district (\\\"Huyện Krông Pa\\\"), and a province (\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\").  The core of the problem lies in the fact that the Vietnamese government has restructured these administrative units.\\n\\nMy first thought was to check for province-level changes.  The user's information about Resolution 60-NQ/TW got me on the right track. I confirmed that \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\" as a province still exists, even if its composition has changed. The old \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\" is still the new \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\" in name, but it merged with Binh Dinh.\\n\\nNext, I focused on the district level. The user stated that all districts were eliminated, which means \\\"Huyện Krông Pa\\\" no longer exists as a district. The question is, where did the wards in it go?\\n\\nTo figure this out, I turned to the user's provided resolutions, specifically \\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\". However, this resolution is for Đắk Lắk province, not Gia Lai. I carefully checked the resolution line by line, especially looking for any mention of the district, \\\"Krông Pa\\\". Line 73 caught my eye because it mentions \\\"xã Krông Pa\\\", which at first glance seems relevant.  Upon further analysis, it becomes clear that this is a ward named \\\"Krông Pa\\\" in Đắk Lắk, not the \\\"Huyện Krông Pa\\\" district in Gia Lai.\\n\\nThe wards list provided also threw up a red herring, both wards are in Đắk Lắk, while the old address is in Gia Lai. My analysis of province mergers confirmed Gia Lai did not merge with Đắk Lắk. This leads me to believe the provided resolutions are irrelevant.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based on the information available, I can confirm that the district, Huyện Krông Pa, no longer exists. However, I can't conclusively identify the current administrative unit for Xã Ia HDreh. The user must provide a new set of resolutions, that are specific to Gia Lai. The current information suggests the old address lies in a province that has not changed its name. It is likely a new ward will need to be identified.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Ia HDreh, Huyện Krông Pa, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 8212,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0027428,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Mapping Address \\\\\\\"Xã Ia HDreh, Huyện Krông Pa, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\" to New Administrative Units**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, let's break this down systematically. The user has given me an old Vietnamese address and some resolutions and new ward data to map it to the current administrative structure. My first step is to isolate the components: \\\\\\\"Xã Ia HDreh\\\\\\\" (the old ward), \\\\\\\"Huyện Krông Pa\\\\\\\" (the old district), and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\" (the old province).\\\\n\\\\nNow, the 60-NQ/TW resolution comes into play. It mentions province mergers, and thankfully, \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\" remains intact. So far, so good.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to check for ward-specific resolutions. The resolution provided, 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, deals with \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\". The address I'm working with is in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\". This immediately raises a red flag.  The resolution only includes \\\\\\\"Krông Pắc\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Krông Pa\\\\\\\" in the context of Đắk Lắk, but the input is a *district* in Gia Lai. I have to be extremely precise here. While \\\\\\\"Krông Pa\\\\\\\" appears in the resolution, it's referring to a *ward* in Đắk Lắk, not the *district* in Gia Lai.\\\\n\\\\nThe provided new ward data only concerns \\\\\\\"Xã Suối Trai\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Krông Pắc\\\\\\\", both in Đắk Lắk. Again, the input address is in Gia Lai. This further confirms that I don't have the data I need.\\\\n\\\\nLooking at it holistically, \\\\\\\"Xã Ia HDreh\\\\\\\" is not mentioned in any of the resolutions. \\\\\\\"Huyện Krông Pa\\\\\\\" appears but in a completely different province, specifically Đắk Lắk and not in the context of it being a district within Gia Lai.  Since the prompt explicitly states that insufficient information warrants a low-confidence response, and I haven't found a match, I have to conclude that a definitive mapping isn't possible with the current data.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, my output will be: \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\" unchanged, no new ward found, low confidence, and no specific citation for this specific mapping. I can't generate a definitive mapping, and a low-confidence response is the most accurate given the limitations. I need better resolution specificity, or at least some corroborating evidence from the resolution.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Gia Lai và tỉnh Bình Định, lấy tên là tỉnh Gia Lai\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Ia HDreh, Huyện Krông Pa, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 7132,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0027428,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Mapping Unclear Due to Insufficient Data**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user needs me to translate an old Vietnamese address, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ia HDreh, Huyện Krông Pa, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", into its new administrative structure, given the resolutions and new ward data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I parsed out the components: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ia HDreh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Krông Pa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the province.  I immediately checked the province mergers per resolution 60-NQ/TW, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as per that information, so that's easy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I moved on to the ward-specific resolutions. The provided resolution, 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, addresses changes in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  So, it won't be applicable here. I need to be careful, though, because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Krông Pa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" appears in the Đắk Lắk resolution, but it refers to a *ward* and, as such, it is not relevant to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Krông Pa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is a key distinction.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI checked the new ward data, and those are all in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't listed with any updates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the evidence, I can't confidently map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ia HDreh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  There's no resolution specifically mentioning it, nor does the data on new wards include this area.  The resolution mentioning \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Krông Pa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't apply because it's about a different province. As the brief states, the confidence must be set low since there isn't enough information to be definitive. The output will reflect that lack of certainty. No new ward name or code can be produced due to the lack of evidence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Gia Lai và tỉnh Bình Định, lấy tên là tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ]\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
