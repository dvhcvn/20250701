  "thought": "**Analyzing the Administrative Reorganization**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The task is to figure out the new ward for the old address \"Xã Ia Pal, Huyện Chư Sê, Tỉnh Gia Lai.\"  I'll go step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I recognize that \"Xã Ia Pal\" is the old ward and \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\" is the old province. Simple enough.\n\nNext, I need to check the province resolutions to see if there's been any change at that level. Resolution \"60-NQ/TW\" doesn't actually impact Gia Lai in any manner relevant to this specific ward.\n\nNow, the critical part.  I'll focus on resolution \"1664/NQ-UBTVQH15,\" which specifically deals with rearranging administrative units at the commune level in Gia Lai province.  Line 53 immediately grabs my attention. It states the merging of several wards, including \"Xã Ia Pal,\" into a new ward called \"Xã Chư Sê.\" Bingo!  That's a direct match, and a very strong indicator.\n\nTo confirm, I'll quickly glance at the list of new wards. Sure enough, there's an entry for \"Xã Chư Sê,\" and the province name matches what I've identified. The matching JSON will be built according to the steps. Province name is \"Tỉnh Gia Lai,\" ward name is \"Xã Chư Sê\", ward code is \"23941\" and the citation is \"1664/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Gia Lai\" line \"53\". With a \"high\" confidence level because this is a direct, explicit mapping with a solid citation.\n\nJust to be thorough, I will scan the remaining entries in the resolution and the new wards list to verify that there isn't another scenario that matches. There is no other scenario that is a better match. \"Xã Al Bá\" is mentioned as a new ward, but it's the product of the merging of other old wards. \"Xã Ayun\" also exists in the system as an old ward that is merged into \"Xã Al Bá\" and \"Xã Ia Pa\" is not mentioned in the resolutions provided.\n\nI'm confident in \"Xã Chư Sê\" as the new ward for \"Xã Ia Pal.\"\n",
