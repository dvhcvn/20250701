  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Ia Tiêm\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been given an old address, \"Xã Ia Tiêm, Huyện Chư Sê, Tỉnh Gia Lai,\" and I need to figure out its new administrative unit (ward).  I'm dealing with provincial and ward-level reorganizations, which means I need to be careful with province mergers and ward name changes.\n\nFirst, I parsed the address.  I extracted \"Xã Ia Tiêm\" as the old ward name and \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\" as the old province name. The province is important because province names can change due to mergers.\n\nNext, I checked the province resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW. I wanted to see if Gia Lai was listed for any province mergers. It wasn't in the list of provinces that *don't* change, but I found it in the *merger* list.  Specifically, it mentions a potential merger with Bình Định. Luckily, it says the result is still \"Tỉnh Gia Lai.\" So, I can keep \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\" as the province for the new ward.\n\nThe most crucial step was checking the other resolution, 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15.  I scanned the resolution text for \"Ia Tiêm\" and hit paydirt on line 54. It stated that \"Ia Tiêm\" was being merged into a new ward called \"Xã Bờ Ngoong.\" That's a direct match!\n\nTo confirm, I looked at the provided new ward list. I found \"Xã Bờ Ngoong\" there, with the code \"23947\" and province name \"Tỉnh Gia Lai,\" matching my previous findings. This further confirms my initial reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the output should be a JSON object with the ward name \"Xã Bờ Ngoong,\" the province name \"Tỉnh Gia Lai,\" and the ward code \"23947.\" The citation will be from 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 54, which states the direct merger. The confidence is high because of this specific mention.\n\nI also considered whether other resolutions or new wards could be relevant, but given the provided data, I'm confident there is only one correct output.\n",
