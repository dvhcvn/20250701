  "thought": "**Thought Process: Mapping an Old Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, I've got a tricky request here.  The user wants me to map an old Vietnamese administrative unit to its new equivalent. Let's break this down systematically. First, I need to analyze the input: an old ward, \"Xã Đăk Roong, Huyện KBang, Tỉnh Gia Lai\", and a set of resolutions, along with a list of new wards.\n\n**Step 1: Province-Level Mapping**\n\nThe province is \"Tỉnh Gia Lai.\" Resolution `60-NQ/TW` is my starting point for province-level changes. After reviewing the section on \"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất,\" it clearly states that \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\" *remains* \"Tỉnh Gia Lai,\" albeit with the addition of Bình Định.\n\n**Step 2: District Level Information (Implied)**\n\nThe user mentioned that the government has eliminated districts. While helpful context, it doesn't directly inform the province-level mapping.  So, I make note that KBang is a district, and this might be a clue for the ward level mapping.\n\n**Step 3: Ward-Level Mapping (The Challenge)**\n\nThe core challenge is finding the new ward for \"Xã Đăk Roong.\" I need to sift through the provided resolutions.  `1660/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Đắk Lắk) is out because it's the wrong province. `1664/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Gia Lai) is for the right province, but it doesn't mention \"Xã Đăk Roong\" directly. There's a section merging a Kbang market town, and Lơ Ku and Đak Smar wards, which is *close* but not the right match.\n\n**The Twist: A Close Call, but in the Wrong Province!**\n\nThen there's `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Quảng Ngãi). This one *almost* clicks. Line 61 mentions \"xã Đăk Rơ Ông.\" That's incredibly similar to \"Xã Đăk Roong\"! The problem? The resolution is for Quảng Ngãi, not Gia Lai. I'm starting to wonder if there's a typo in the input or the resolution. \"Roong\" versus \"Rơ Ông\" could just be a spelling variation. Looking at the new wards, there's a \"Xã Đăk Tờ Kan\" in Quảng Ngãi.\n\n**Re-evaluation: Low Confidence, but a Candidate**\n\nOkay, let's step back. Province mapping is clear. However, ward mapping is problematic. None of the *Gia Lai* resolutions mention \"Xã Đăk Roong\".  The `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15` resolution from *Quảng Ngãi* is a very *close* match for the name (Đăk Rơ Ông), leading to Đăk Tờ Kan as a new entity.\n\nThe key issue is the province mismatch. The prompt stresses using *only* provided text. My confidence in matching \"Xã Đăk Roong\" to Đăk Tờ Kan is inherently low. It's a plausible, but uncertain, link. The name similarity is compelling, but the different province is a dealbreaker. So, although this is the best candidate, there is no direct link, hence the low confidence.\n\n**Final Output**\n\nI'll propose \"Xã Đăk Tờ Kan\" as a candidate (from the Quảng Ngãi resolution) and give it a 'low' confidence rating because of the province mismatch. I will also cite the resolution and the specific line within it.\n\n**The JSON:**\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\",\n    \"ward_name\": \"Xã Đăk Tờ Kan\",\n    \"ward_code\": \"23419\",\n    \"confidence\": \"low\",\n    \"citation\": {\n      \"header\": \"1677/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\",\n      \"line\": \"61. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Đăk Rơ Ông và xã Đăk Tờ Kan thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Đăk Tờ Kan.\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThat should be the best solution given the limitations. Let's submit this and see if it meets the requirements.\n",

My initial thought is to break this down into manageable steps: understand the old unit, parse the resolutions, look for possible connections, and then generate the JSON output the user needs.\\n\\nFirst, I clarified the task. I need to comb through these resolutions, specifically looking for mentions of \\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\" or related place names.  The objective is to identify the corresponding new ward(s), flag my confidence level, and package the final answer in that specific JSON format.\\n\\nNext, I started by analyzing what I already know about \\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\": it's in KBang district, which is in Gia Lai province. This provincial information is key to navigating the resolutions. I know that province mergers are something that is included in the resolutions.\\n\\nI began by checking 60-NQ/TW, the resolution for provincial mergers.  I needed to establish if Gia Lai was merged. Yes, \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\" merged with \\\"Tỉnh Bình Định,\\\" but *retained* the name \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\".  This means \\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\" still resides within \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai,\\\" which helps me narrow down the search.\\n\\nThen, I shifted my focus to the other resolutions. 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 focused on Đắk Lắk province.  I skipped this since my ward is from Gia Lai. I then examined 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, a resolution from Gia Lai.  Line 63 described a rearrangement in Kbang district, but didn't mention \\\"Xã Đăk Roong.\\\"  The listed merging entities (\\\"thị trấn Kbang, xã Lơ Ku, and xã Đak Smar\\\") do not contain the input name.\\n\\nThen I moved onto 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15 (for Quảng Ngãi province), but quickly realized this isn't relevant based on what I established in the provincial merges above. However, the similarity between \\\"Đăk Rơ Ông\\\" (in the Quảng Ngãi resolution) and \\\"Đăk Roong\\\" caught my eye. It's possible there's a typo in the original request or the resolution. But given the provinces involved, this is unlikely. This felt like a dead end.\\n\\nI then considered the \\\"New Wards List.\\\" It became clear that there are two places that exist in the \\\"New Wards List\\\" that are in the wrong province. However, I did find a new ward (\\\"Xã Kbang\\\") that's in the correct province.\\n\\nSo, here's my current assessment: The most likely result is \\\"Xã Kbang\\\" from resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, even though there's no direct mention of \\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\". The other candidates are in the wrong province and are not viable. I'm reasonably confident in this result given that there's no better information available and that it's in the same district, though I'd need confirmation from the user to be sure. I'll need to flag the potential name similarity with Quảng Ngãi for further investigation if needed, and will provide the result in the required JSON format.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Đăk Roong, Huyện KBang, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 14372,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.002744,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Analysis of Ward Re-Mapping for Gia Lai Province**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's the situation as I see it. The user wants me to map an old administrative unit, specifically `Xã Đăk Roong` in `Huyện KBang`, `Tỉnh Gia Lai`, to its new designation.  I have resolutions to work with, at both the province and ward levels.  My understanding is that I'm looking for direct mentions or indirect indicators within these resolutions that illuminate how `Xã Đăk Roong` has been re-assigned.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I assessed the province-level changes. The resolution `60-NQ/TW` indicates that the old `Tỉnh Gia Lai` merged with `Tỉnh Bình Định`, but retained the name `Tỉnh Gia Lai`. This means the *territorial composition* of Gia Lai has changed, but the province name itself remains constant.  This provides crucial context; I need to keep in mind that the boundaries of Gia Lai now encompass a larger area than before.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I delved into the specific ward-level resolutions. I had to sift through resolutions, focusing on those concerning `Tỉnh Gia Lai`. I quickly eliminated resolutions for other provinces like Đắk Lắk and Quảng Ngãi.\\\\n\\\\nThe resolution for `Tỉnh Gia Lai` (1664/NQ-UBTVQH15) piqued my interest.  It mentions `Huyện Kbang`, which is where our target ward, `Xã Đăk Roong`, is located. However, a close inspection of this resolution reveals that while it describes a merger of `thị trấn Kbang`, `xã Lơ Ku`, and `xã Đak Smar` into a new `xã Kbang`, there's *no* mention of `Xã Đăk Roong`.\\\\n\\\\nI was briefly distracted by a similar-sounding ward in a Quảng Ngãi resolution (`Đăk Rơ Ông`), but quickly dismissed it. The name is subtly different and the province is wrong.  It's clear that this is unrelated to the Gia Lai mapping.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, after thoroughly reviewing the provided resolutions, I conclude that while the province of `Tỉnh Gia Lai` underwent a merger with `Tỉnh Bình Định`, I haven't yet identified any specific resolution detailing the re-assignment of `Xã Đăk Roong`. The Gia Lai resolution mentions KBang but not directly Roong. More information is needed to definitively map `Xã Đăk Roong`.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong, Huyện KBang, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 15861,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0030265,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Processing the Administrative Address Change**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, here's what I've figured out so far. The user wants me to find the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong, Huyện KBang, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  I've broken this down:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **Old Address Analysis:** I've confirmed the old address components: Xã Đăk Roong (Ward), Huyện KBang (District), and Tỉnh Gia Lai (Province).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **Province Check:** The good news is, the province name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" hasn't changed. According to Resolution 60-NQ/TW, the province didn't merge with another. That's a simple start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n3.  **Resolution Scan:** Now, the tricky part – the user provided resolutions to check for ward/district changes. I've been diligently scanning them.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *   Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Đắk Lắk): Dismissed; it's the wrong province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *   Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Gia Lai): This one is promising. It *does* mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện KBang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but it describes the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lơ Ku\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đak Smar\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It doesn't explicitly mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *directly* in the snippet provided.  This is a potential avenue for further research. I'll need to investigate if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was included in this reorganization, even if not explicitly stated in this section of the resolution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *   Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Quảng Ngãi): I had to consider this one because it mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Rơ Ông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which sounds very similar to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  This raised a red flag initially. The similarity is striking, but the province is wrong (Quảng Ngãi instead of Gia Lai). The province mismatch strongly suggests this isn't relevant.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n4.  **New Ward List Analysis:** I've cross-referenced this with the list of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" provided.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *   The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" entries are immediately discarded because they are the wrong province and correspond to the name similarity in resolution 1677, which is a false lead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    *   The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" entry is highly relevant. It corresponds to the merge outlined in Resolution 1664, and the old address was in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện KBang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This implies that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *might* be incorporated into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, I'd need further verification to confirm this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Next Steps:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI need to dig deeper into Resolution 1664 (Gia Lai) to see if it specifically addresses the inclusion or exclusion of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I will also look for any other supporting documentation which specifically clarifies the new administrative assignments in this area of Gia Lai.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1677/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"61.

The goal is to figure out the new administrative unit for an old Vietnamese address. Let's break this down systematically.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I've got to extract the key components from the old address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the old ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện KBang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the old district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the old province). Easy enough.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to check for any province mergers. The good news is, Gia Lai is stable according to the provided resolution 60-NQ/TW.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow the real work begins. I'll need to pore over the resolutions, specifically looking for mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện KBang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, a key piece of the puzzle, tells me about the formation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Gia Lai from a few wards and a town. However, and this is crucial, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* explicitly mentioned in any of these resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, I'll turn to the new wards list, focusing on Gia Lai. Aha! There's a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with code \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"23638\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The resolution I found does seem to relate the old district name, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện KBang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", to the creation of this new ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis is where it gets tricky. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is missing. I have to make an inference. Given the lack of a direct mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in any specific merger or split resolution, and the connection between the old district and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", I have to assume one of several possibilities: either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", renamed directly, or assigned to another new ward (but not one listed here). Without explicit confirmation, I can't say with certainty.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, my confidence level for this mapping is low. The best I can provide is the province, the new ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), its code, the relevant resolution citation, but I have to acknowledge the uncertainty. A definitive answer requires more information.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1664/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"63.

The provided address is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong, Huyện KBang, Tỉnh Gia Lai,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to consider province mergers, ward reorganizations, and any relevant resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I parsed the old address. I have \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện KBang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the old district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the old province. Good starting point.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I checked for any province mergers. The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" document confirms that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" No changes there, which simplifies things a bit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, I dove into the resolutions. I'm looking for direct mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện KBang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Resolution \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1664/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is relevant, creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kbang, xã Lơ Ku và xã Đak Smar.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Importantly, my old ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the resolutions. This is where things get tricky.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI scanned the new ward list. I found \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which the resolution mentioned. I know that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was created from a combination of old wards, so \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" might be part of it, or it could have become another new ward, or been renamed altogether.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBased on all this, I'm confident about a few things: The new province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and the district \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện KBang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is related to the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, since \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Roong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't mentioned explicitly in any of the resolutions, I have to assume a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" confidence level.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConsequently, my proposed JSON output will include:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `province_name`: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `ward_name`: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kbang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (because of its relation to the old district and the lack of other clear options)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `ward_code`: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"23638\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `confidence`: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `citation`: The relevant resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis mapping is the best I can do with the available data.
