  "thought": "**Processing the Request: Finding the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user's request is to find the updated administrative unit for \"Xã Ia Dom, Huyện Đức Cơ, Tỉnh Gia Lai\".\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial setup. We have:\n\n*   **Old Ward:** \"Xã Ia Dom, Huyện Đức Cơ, Tỉnh Gia Lai\"\n*   **Old District:** \"Huyện Đức Cơ\"\n*   **Old Province:** \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\"\n\nThe user's comment about districts being eliminated is a crucial starting point. Now, I have to determine if \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\" changed.\n\nChecking the province resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW), I see that Gia Lai was *not* merged into a new, differently named entity. However, there's a key piece of information: Gia Lai *merged with Bình Định* but kept the name Gia Lai. This adds complexity, but it doesn't immediately affect the ward name directly.\n\nNext, I have to go through the provided resolutions, looking for mentions of \"Ia Dom\", \"Đức Cơ\", or \"Gia Lai\". The most critical finding comes from Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15. It explicitly states that \"Ia Dom\" is *one of nine wards in Gia Lai that were not rearranged*. This is strong evidence that \"Xã Ia Dom\" continues to exist under the same name.\n\nI then identified this data:\n*   `{\"ward_code\":\"23872\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ia Dom\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\"}`\n    *   This is the confirmation! A direct match, confirming that the new ward is indeed \"Xã Ia Dom\" in \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\".\n*   `{\"ward_code\":\"23538\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ia Tơi\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\"}`\n    *   The second match describes a \"Xã Ia Tơi\" in \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\".\n\nBased on my analysis, \"Xã Ia Dom\" in Gia Lai *was not* changed and still exists with the same name.\n",

The user wants the updated administrative unit for \\\"Xã Ia Dom, Huyện Đức Cơ, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\".  I started by breaking down the address: Xã Ia Dom is the ward, Huyện Đức Cơ is the district, and Tỉnh Gia Lai is the province. The tricky part is figuring out if \\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\" still exists as is.\\n\\nFirst, I checked for province resolutions (like 60-NQ/TW) but that's not too relevant in this case.  The user's input mentions a merger with Bình Định, but \\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\" remains the name. So, I need to focus on what happened *within* Gia Lai.\\n\\nNext, I dove into some crucial resolutions. Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15 (for Gia Lai) looks promising. Line 99 talks about creating a new ward \\\"Xã Đức Cơ\\\".  The old district was also \\\"Huyện Đức Cơ,\\\" so this seems relevant. However, line 127 *explicitly* lists \\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\" as *not* being rearranged. Bingo! That's a strong indication.\\n\\nThen, there's Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15.  This one is for Quảng Ngãi, but it mentions a \\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\" being merged into \\\"Xã Ia Tơi\\\".  That's a bit confusing – a potential name collision.  Are there two \\\"Ia Dom\\\"s in different provinces?  It's a possibility, but since the user's address is *specifically* in Gia Lai, the Quảng Ngãi resolution is less important.\\n\\nFinally, I checked my \\\"New wards\\\" data.  I found an entry confirming \\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\" exists in Gia Lai. That seals it! It all lines up with Resolution 1664 – \\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\" was *not* rearranged. There is also an \\\"Xã Đức Cơ\\\" created in Gia Lai, but that's a different ward.  The one in Quảng Ngãi confirms that \\\"Ia Tơi\\\" exists as well.\\n\\nTherefore, my conclusion: The new administrative unit for \\\"Xã Ia Dom, Huyện Đức Cơ, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\" is still **Xã Ia Dom** within the updated administrative structure of Tỉnh Gia Lai. It remained unchanged in the re-organization.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1664/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Gia Lai\",\n        \"line\": \"127.

Now, let's dive into the specifics.\\\\n\\\\nI've examined the key resolutions. Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15 mentions several changes in Gia Lai, including the formation of \\\\\\\"xã Đức Cơ,\\\\\\\" but doesn't touch on \\\\\\\"Ia Dom\\\\\\\" directly. However, it *explicitly* lists \\\\\\\"Ia Dom\\\\\\\" as one of the communes *not* undergoing rearrangement. This strongly suggests that \\\\\\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\\\\\" continues to exist as \\\\\\\"Xã Ia Dom.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe other relevant resolution, 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, describes a merger of \\\\\\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\\\\\" into \\\\\\\"Xã Ia Tơi.\\\\\\\" **However**, this is related to Quảng Ngãi province, not the \\\\\\\"Ia Dom\\\\\\\" in Gia Lai that we're interested in. It's crucial to pay close attention to the provincial context!\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to check the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" list for a direct match. After searching the list, I found `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"23872\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\"}`.  **Perfect!** This is exactly what we were looking for. The ward name is \\\\\\\"Xã Ia Dom,\\\\\\\" and the province is \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Gia Lai,\\\\\\\" matching the original address.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Ia Dom, Huyện Đức Cơ, Tỉnh Gia Lai\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\"Xã Ia Dom\\\\\\\" because the area was never merged or re-arranged based on the resources available.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập:\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"1.
