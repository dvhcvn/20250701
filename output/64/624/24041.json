  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vietnamese address mapping task. The user wants me to translate an old address, specifically \"Phường Cheo Reo\", \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\", into the new administrative framework.  My thinking goes like this: first, I need to understand the historical context and the changes implemented.\n\nI'm starting with the obvious: identifying the old ward (\"Phường Cheo Reo\") and province (\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\").  Then, I'm diving into the resolutions, which is where the real work begins. I've got to check resolution 60-NQ/TW to see if Gia Lai was slated for any province-level mergers.  Turns out, it wasn't a province slated for elimination, although it did absorb Bình Định. So, the old province name \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\" is still valid.\n\nNext up, the crucial part: other resolutions. I know resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15 is a goldmine for these ward-level changes.  I've got to search within that resolution's lines for a mention of \"Phường Cheo Reo.\" Bingo! Line 126 is the key. It specifically states that \"Phường Cheo Reo\" was merged into a new ward called \"**phường Ayun Pa**.\" That's a direct mapping, and I'm feeling confident about this.\n\nNow, I cross-reference this information with the list of \"New wards.\"  I need to find \"phường Ayun Pa\" in that list to confirm the ward code and province name. Yep, there it is! I've confirmed that \"phường Ayun Pa\" has the ward code \"24044\" and belongs to \"Tỉnh Gia Lai,\" which, naturally, matches the province name I found earlier.\n\nFinally, putting it all together for the output. I'm building that JSON payload.  I'm citing the resolution (1664/NQ-UBTVQH15) since that's the source. The confidence is high because it's a direct mapping. I've got \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\" for the province name. The ward code is \"24044\", and the ward name is \"Phường Ayun Pa\". Perfect. This should be a reliable translation of the old address into the new system.\n",
