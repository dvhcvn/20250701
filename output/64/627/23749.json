  "thought": "**My Analysis of Address Mapping: Xã Ia Ka, Gia Lai**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with mapping the old address \"Xã Ia Ka, Huyện Chư Păh, Tỉnh Gia Lai\" to its new administrative unit. My initial thought process is to break this down systematically. First, I identify the key components: the old ward (\"Xã Ia Ka\"), district (\"Huyện Chư Păh\"), and province (\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\").  The \"eliminating all districts\" instruction is a key indicator for how to move forward, so I keep that in mind.\n\nMy next step is to consult the province-level resolutions (specifically, 60-NQ/TW). I'm looking for any information on how Gia Lai has changed. Fortunately, it's pretty clear: Gia Lai *is* affected by a merger with Bình Định, but remarkably, the name remains \"Gia Lai\". This is good news, as it means the province name doesn't change from the old address to the new one.\n\nNow I focus on the ward-level resolutions, especially 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15.  Bingo! Line 46 in the resolution directly addresses \"Xã Ia Ka\". It states, in no uncertain terms, that \"Xã Ia Ka\" is merged into \"Xã Ia Phí\". This is a direct hit!  I make a note of this resolution number and line; it's the key to this mapping.\n\nTo solidify my analysis, I consult the provided new ward data.  I search for \"Xã Ia Phí,\" and there it is:  `{\"ward_code\":\"23749\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ia Phí\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Gia Lai\"}`.  The match is perfect.\n\nBuilding the output JSON is straightforward at this point. Given the direct resolution linking the old ward to the new, I can confidently set the `confidence` level to \"high\". The `citation` will be \"1664/NQ-UBTVQH15\" line \"46\". The province name stays \"Tỉnh Gia Lai\", the `ward_code` is \"23749\" and the `ward_name` is \"Xã Ia Phí\".\n\nRegarding other potential new wards (as the prompt requests, for completeness), I briefly consider the resolution's mention of \"Chư Păh\" (the old address' district). While the districts themselves are eliminated, it's worth noting that the name \"Chư Păh\" might be relevant in a broader re-organization. However, since the primary resolution specifically states Ia Ka becomes Ia Phí, I don't need to entertain \"Chư Păh\" as a main candidate. Ia Phí is the clear and definitive match. This is a very clean and conclusive resolution.\n",
