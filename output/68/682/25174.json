  "thought": "**Initial Assessment: Navigating the Unknown**\n\nMy task is to decipher the user's request and map an old administrative ward, specifically `Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng`, to its new counterpart, guided by a set of resolutions.  The primary hurdle is the absence of a direct reference to the input ward within the available documents.  Initially, my strategy focuses on meticulously analyzing the provided resolutions, line by line, for any mention of \"Xã Mỹ Lâm\" within Lâm Đồng province.  I've also got to consider the merged province names and look for \"New Wards.\"\n\n**Deep Dive into Resolutions: A Trail of Missing Data**\n\nI began by scrutinizing each resolution, paying close attention to any mention of \"Xã Mỹ Lâm\".  However, the search proved fruitless within the context of Lâm Đồng.  I found references to \"Mỹ Lâm\" in resolutions concerning An Giang and Tuyên Quang provinces, but these were irrelevant to the input request.\n\n**The List of New Wards: A Silent Witness**\n\nNext, I examined the list of new wards, hoping to identify a related name or potential merger.  Yet, this avenue also led to dead ends.  Although the new wards in Đạ Huoai district (the input's district) were listed, none of them were named \"Xã Mỹ Lâm.\"  This raised the possibility of incomplete information or a name change not documented in the provided data.\n\n**The Turning Point: Acknowledging Uncertainty**\n\nWith the evidence mounting against a definitive match, I confronted the reality: the existing resolutions did not offer a clear answer. The absence of specific mapping information for `Xã Mỹ Lâm` from `Tỉnh Lâm Đồng` presented a clear problem. It suggested that a resolution specifically addressing this particular ward's fate was missing or that the user's input might have a small error. The prompt did ask me to use a low-confidence response if needed.\n\n**Re-evaluating and Strategic Compromise**\n\nRecognizing the lack of conclusive evidence, I was compelled to adapt.  Since the prompt permits for less-than-definitive answers, I decided to consider if the user might have made a typo or if they had the wrong province. I carefully reviewed the resolutions again, with a fresh perspective, and identified two potential matches from the available data.  If the input was from An Giang or Tuyên Quang, I could build a response.\n\n**A Low-Confidence Approach: Presenting the Possibilities**\n\nBy carefully reviewing the available data, I've created a JSON response containing two low-confidence mappings of other \"Xã Mỹ Lâm\" units.\n\nMy final course of action, given the inherent ambiguity, is to present these plausible associations, accompanied by a clear indication of my uncertainty and an explanation of the underlying assumptions. This strategy aligns with the prompt's instructions, ensuring a transparent and responsible approach to a complex and data-deficient request.\n",

The user's asking about \\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\" - the old ward, district, and province. My job is to find the new equivalent.\\n\\nFirst things first, I've confirmed the old administrative details: \\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\" (ward), \\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai\\\" (district), and \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\" (province).\\n\\nNow, based on my understanding of Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW), the province name stays the same – \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\".  I cross-referenced this with the \\\"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\" section and confirmed that the province name remains \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\"\\n\\nNext step: examining the provided resolutions for ward-level changes. I methodically checked each resolution, focusing on any mentions of \\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\", \\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai\\\", or \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\".\\n\\n*   I went through resolutions 1654, 1661, 1667, 1678, and 1684, finding that none of them were relevant as they covered other provinces.\\n\\n*   Resolution 1671 (Lâm Đồng) looked promising. However, while it mentions \\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai\\\" by creating three new wards that use this name (\\\"Đạ Huoai\\\", \\\"Đạ Huoai 2\\\", \\\"Đạ Huoai 3\\\"), I couldn't find any direct reference to \\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\" as part of these new formations. This could be due to s a partial restructuring or renaming.\\n\\n*   I was momentarily distracted by resolution 1684 (Tuyên Quang), where \\\"Mỹ Lâm\\\" did appear, but quickly realized this was a different administrative unit in a different province (\\\"Tuyên Quang\\\"), so I discarded it. I have to avoid this kind of confusion.\\n\\nFinally, examining the \\\"New wards\\\" data provided, I found these new wards in \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\": \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai\\\", \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2\\\", and \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 3\\\".\\n\\nMy conclusion at this stage is that while \\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai\\\" is present in the new ward names, \\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\" is not explicitly mentioned as forming part of the new wards. Given the available data, I need to look for any additional sources of information or potentially request clarification about what type of relationship the user is interested in. It's likely I'm missing something, or the data source is not completely comprehensive.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 18750,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0038025000000000003,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Navigating the Administrative Unit Landscape**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with a request to pinpoint the new administrative unit corresponding to the old ward \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\" My thought process starts with a clear breakdown of the given information: \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to check the Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW). The input province is \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\" I find that Lâm Đồng, Đắk Nông, and Bình Thuận have been merged, resulting in a new \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\" This impacts the broader context, but it doesn't immediately pinpoint the old ward's new form.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I delve into the \\\\\\\"Other Resolutions\\\\\\\" provided, scrutinizing each for any mention of the old ward or its components.\\\\n\\\\n*   1654/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15, and 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 don't relate to the given information.\\\\n\\\\n*   1671/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Lâm Đồng) is essential. I carefully examine each line. I notice several relevant points:\\\\n    *   Line 33 indicates a name change in that district, but it mentions \\\\\\\"Mađaguôi\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Đạ Oai,\\\\\\\" not \\\\\\\"Mỹ Lâm.\\\\\\\"\\\\n    *   Line 34 mentions a name change in that district, but it mentions \\\\\\\"Hà Lâm,\\\\\\\" not \\\\\\\"Mỹ Lâm.\\\\\\\"\\\\n    *   Line 120 mentions \\\\\\\"Bà Gia,\\\\\\\" not \\\\\\\"Mỹ Lâm.\\\\\\\"\\\\n    *   Crucially, none of these lines address my target ward, \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n*   1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tuyên Quang) is quickly ruled out as it pertains to a different province, although there is a \\\\\\\"phường Mỹ Lâm.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow, it's time to analyze the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" list for a potential match. Because \\\\\\\"Đạ Huoai\\\\\\\" is the district, I focus on searching for new wards with a similar name in Lâm Đồng. From the list, I identify the following possibilities:\\\\n*   \\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai.\\\\\\\"\\\\n*   \\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2.\\\\\\\"\\\\n*   \\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 3.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThese new wards are within Tỉnh Lâm Đồng and share a thematic connection to the original district name, making them strong candidates. Further analysis would be required to definitively confirm the mapping, but based on this initial processing, it's safe to deduce the likely possibilities.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"25099\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"25105\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"25114\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 3\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 16995,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0033049999999999998,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Address Change**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, the user wants me to find the new administrative unit for the address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Here's what I'm thinking:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I break down the address. We've got: Xã Mỹ Lâm (the ward), Huyện Đạ Huoai (the district), and Tỉnh Lâm Đồng (the province). The key is the user's information: districts are being eliminated. That immediately tells me I need to focus on finding the new province and, critically, what's happening to the wards within the old district.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first step is checking for province-level changes.  The user's data isn't from the most recent resolution, but this kind of stuff always starts with the biggest picture.  I immediately find Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which details provincial mergers.  Line 14 says that Lâm Đồng, Đắk Nông, and Bình Thuận will *merge* into a single province, still called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Whew, that's straightforward. So, the province remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the tricky part: the wards. I need to find the specific resolutions that deal with Lâm Đồng and its wards.  I'm looking at Resolution 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15, which is about the rearrangement of wards in Lâm Đồng province.  This is promising.  I scan the resolution and spot a few interesting lines: it looks like several communes in the old Đạ Huoai district are being combined.  One creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from Mađaguôi, Đạ Oai; another creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from Đạ M'ri, Hà Lâm; and finally, Bà Gia is being renamed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đạ Huoai 3.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Notice the pattern? It *looks* like the old district name is being used as a reference point for the new ward names.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem: none of these resolutions specifically mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the original ward in the user's address. This means I've got to cast a wider net and look at *all* the other resolutions to see if I've missed something.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI do a search across all the resolutions for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in case there's a different province involved. I find resolution 1654 for An Giang province. This one *does* have a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being merged into a new ward called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vĩnh Thông.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, this is in a completely different province, so it's irrelevant.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, I'm stuck. I've found a bunch of changes to wards within the old Đạ Huoai district, but nothing about the *specific* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the user's asking about.  It's possible that this information isn't in a resolution. It may be handled by local resolutions, or perhaps the merger has not yet occurred. More searching is needed. I'll need to go deeper into *all* resolutions to ensure that I have captured all sources.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"25099\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"25105\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"25114\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 3\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 10353,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.00413,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Determining the Fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tasked with identifying the new administrative unit for the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  First things first, I need to verify if the province has changed.  The old address specifies \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so I'll check `60-NQ/TW` for any provincial mergers.  No surprises there, section 14 confirms that the province remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the trickier part: the ward.  I'm looking for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within Lâm Đồng.  I start by examining the relevant resolutions for Lâm Đồng.  Specifically, `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15` which deals with the restructuring of administrative units.  I carefully review the formations, looking for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and its surrounding units.  No luck.  The resolution creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from other combinations of existing wards and towns, but \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is absent.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nJust to be thorough, I check the other resolutions, like `1654/NQ-UBTVQH15` and `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`, but those deal with changes in An Giang and Tuyên Quang, respectively, and are therefore irrelevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, the provided resolutions don't give a clear answer.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't seem to be explicitly transformed or renamed.  Now, I move on to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.  I see three new wards: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 3\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Looking back at the formation process detailed in `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15`, it becomes clear that these new wards arose from consolidations of other units.  Again, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't appear in the formation of any of these new wards.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, based on the provided data, I lack sufficient information to definitively determine which new administrative unit \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been incorporated into. It appears that further investigation or more comprehensive data may be necessary.  I would need more information regarding the specific changes that occurred to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1671/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"33.

My initial approach is to meticulously analyze the relevant resolutions and data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, the province is straightforward. Resolution `60-NQ/TW` clarifies that Lâm Đồng remains a province, so no change there.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I zeroed in on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I scrutinized the provided resolutions, particularly `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15` which deals with administrative adjustments within Lâm Đồng. However, I didn't find any direct reference to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the formations of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 3.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then broadened my search, checking other resolutions, but found irrelevant mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in An Giang and Tuyên Quang provinces. These were quickly ruled out.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBased on the available resolutions alone, it's inconclusive. There is no clear indication of what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Lâm\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in this data set.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I examined the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.
