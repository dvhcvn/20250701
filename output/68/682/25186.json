  "thought": "**Processing the Mapping Request for \"Xã Phù Mỹ\"**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants to map \"Xã Phù Mỹ\" (Ward Phù Mỹ) in \"Huyện Đạ Huoai\" (District Đạ Huoai) within \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\" (Province Lâm Đồng) to its new administrative unit.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the user's request. I've broken it down to its core components: Old ward name, old district name, and old province name.\n\nNext, I have to analyze the context, particularly the resolutions provided. I know \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\" was affected by a merging with Đắk Nông and Bình Thuận, but ultimately still has the same name. That's a key bit of initial information. The real work is in scanning the detailed resolutions for mentions of \"Xã Phù Mỹ,\" \"Huyện Đạ Huoai,\" or \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\"\n\nI started with the most relevant resolution, the one about changes in Lâm Đồng. I'm carefully reading through it, line by line, looking for any sign of \"Phù Mỹ.\" I'm also watching out for Đạ Huoai-related entries, but nothing so far specifically mentions \"Xã Phù Mỹ.\" I'm looking for clues of wards being split or merged, or renamed.\n\nThen I realized that a string of resolutions, like 1675, 1685, 1687, all have variations on the name \"Phú Mỹ\" (Phu Mỹ). But, I remember the instruction to be very specific about the original \"Phù Mỹ\" and the fact that most wards have been changed.\n\nI was getting nowhere, so I thought, maybe it's not Đạ Huoai. So, I went to another batch of resolutions: 1655, 1654, 1664 - they also contain \"Phú Mỹ.\" I also read other resolutions, but the context is all wrong, different provinces altogether.\n\nThen it clicked! Resolution `1664/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Gia Lai) mentioned \"Phù Mỹ\" in the exact form the user input the original ward. I thought I had found my solution, and started to evaluate the changes. Gia Lai's resolution showed that the province of Gia Lai was merging into the municipality of Phù Mỹ.\n\nI thought, \"Aha! Maybe they made a typo?\" But then it dawned on me. The user specified \"Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\" That's not Gia Lai. I have to go back. I reread the resolutions for Lâm Đồng again. I am not finding anything on \"Xã Phù Mỹ.\" This is strange, and something about this feels wrong. It seems to not have been addressed.\n\nI re-evaluate my approach. I've re-read all the resolutions. I can't find \"Xã Phù Mỹ\" mentioned anywhere in the Lâm Đồng documents. So, I am missing something. Maybe it was kept unchanged, but the instructions implied I should be able to find something, even if the confidence is low.\n\nSince it does not appear to exist in these documents, I concluded it's the more correct option to return an empty JSON array `[]`, meaning \"Not found.\" The information needed to make the mapping is not present. This is a very specific mapping question.\n",

The province hasn't changed, based on resolution `60-NQ/TW`, so that's good. Now, I'm focusing on the Lâm Đồng resolution, which is `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15`. I scanned through it, looking for either \\\"Phù Mỹ\\\" or \\\"Đạ Huoai.\\\" I found several lines related to Đạ Huoai, forming new wards, but nothing mentioning \\\"Phù Mỹ.\\\" That's a red flag.\\n\\nGiven the initial negative result, I need to expand my search. I did a global search for \\\"Phù Mỹ\\\" across all relevant resolutions. Interesting... It seems \\\"Phù Mỹ\\\" is a common name! I got hits from An Giang, Cà Mau, Gia Lai, Cần Thơ, Huế, and Phú Thọ – all wrong provinces! Many instances were merging *into* a new \\\"Phù Mỹ,\\\" but not the specific one I'm looking for.\\n\\nI'm starting to think this is a tricky one. The original resolution for Lâm Đồng doesn't list the unit I'm seeking. It's either a very specific localized change within the district that wasn't included in the main resolution, or it's been missed during the database generation.  I'll need to double-check my search parameters and possibly explore sub-resolutions, looking for further detail.  The data is incomplete, requiring further information before I can give a definitive answer. It will probably be easier to go back to the source and check documents manually.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"25099\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Đạ Huoai\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"25105\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Đạ Huoai 2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"25114\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Đạ Huoai 3\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Phù Mỹ, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 18384,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0051716,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change Request**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, I've got a request to figure out the current administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\"  First, I need to break down the address: \\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\" is the province.  My initial thought is to check for any province-level mergers or reorganizations first, then drill down into ward and district-level changes.\\\\n\\\\nChecking the province changes based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW, it looks like Lâm Đồng *did* merge with Đắk Nông and Bình Thuận, but they kept the name \\\\\\\"Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\"  So, no change there for my purposes.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I'm onto the ward and district level. I have a list of resolutions, and I need to find the one that applies to Lâm Đồng. Found it: `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Lâm Đồng`. I'll scan through it to see if it mentions \\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nReading through the lines, I see reorganization within the Đạ Huoai area, merging Mađaguôi, Đạ Oai, Đạ M'ri, Hà Lâm, and Bà Gia.  However, *my* \\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\" isn't mentioned. That tells me this specific resolution doesn't directly address my request.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I need to broaden my search.  I'm going to look through *all* the provided resolutions for \\\\\\\"Phú Mỹ\\\\\\\" (and the similar name \\\\\\\"Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\"), being very mindful of the context - province and whether it's a *xã* (ward) or a *thị trấn* (town).\\\\n\\\\nScanning through the other resolutions, I find multiple instances of \\\\\\\"Phú Mỹ\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Phù Mỹ,\\\\\\\" but none of them are a direct match. An Giang, Cà Mau, Gia Lai, Cần Thơ, Huế, and Phú Thọ all have instances, but the province names are different. The Gia Lai one is concerning, as it uses \\\\\\\"Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\" and includes a *thị trấn*, but the province is wrong.  It's clear I haven't found a direct answer yet. I need more information to process this, it isn't listed in the available resolutions.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"25099\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"25105\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 2\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"25114\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Đạ Huoai 3\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 9359,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0047791,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Determining the Current Administrative Unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, let's break this down systematically. The user's query focuses on an old address, specifically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  My initial focus is confirming that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is still the correct province, and I'm pretty certain there were no significant province mergers affecting it according to Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Yup, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I identify the existing ward and district: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The real work begins with checking official resolutions related to ward-level administrative changes within Lâm Đồng.  I need to find Resolution 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one covering these adjustments.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm meticulously scanning through the resolution, line by line, specifically looking for any mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phù Mỹ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I notice that lines 33, 34 and 120 deal with similar ward reorganizations in Đạ Huoai district, but no cigar. No \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" here.  It seems that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wasn't directly addressed in this specific resolution. I also searched across all other resolutions but it seems it is not mentioned in any of the resolutions related to Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nJust to be thorough, I then checked a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list that has been provided to me.  Here, I'm finding a bunch of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"U\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") but no \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ư\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). All of these \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" variants are in completely different provinces: Gia Lai, Cà Mau, Ho Chi Minh City, Phú Thọ, Vĩnh Long, Cần Thơ, Đắk Lắk, and An Giang.  I see a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mỹ Thượng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Mỹ Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but those aren't it either.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, my conclusion is that based on the provided data, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the resolutions regarding administrative unit changes. Given the information I have, I am unable to determine a new administrative unit and I suggest searching through other sources.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1671/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"33.

My objective is to pinpoint the current administrative designation for the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ, Huyện Đạ Huoai, Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I confirmed that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Lâm Đồng Province) remains unchanged according to the key restructuring document \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  So, that base level is stable.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I zeroed in on the specifics: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the ward, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Đạ Huoai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the district, within Lâm Đồng.  My next step was to comb through the relevant resolution for Lâm Đồng, which is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1671/NQ-UBTVQH15,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" focusing specifically on ward-level changes.  I carefully scanned the document, line by line, looking for any mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phù Mỹ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Unfortunately, the resolution focused on changes in the area of Đạ Huoai, but no modifications were documented specifically for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phù Mỹ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then expanded my search, moving beyond this one document. I meticulously cross-referenced \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" against a database of all new wards.  No entry exactly matched \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and also corresponded with Lâm Đồng Province. There were a few similarly named wards (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") located in other provinces.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, given the available data, I can conclude that there's no readily apparent administrative change specifically referencing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phù Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Lâm Đồng Province.
