  "thought": "**Mapping an Old Vietnamese Address to a New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with mapping an old Vietnamese address, specifically focusing on the ward level, using the provided resolutions and the new ward data. The old address is \"Xã Triệu Ái,\" located in \"Huyện Triệu Phong,\" \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\" My first step, as always, is to break down the address into its components: ward, district, and province. Although the prompt mentions eliminating districts, understanding the context is helpful.\n\nThe resolutions are key here. I'll begin by consulting the province-level resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW).  I need to ascertain whether any province-level boundary adjustments or mergers affect \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\"  Finding \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\" in the relevant section confirms that the province name persists. That's straightforward enough.\n\nNow, on to the granular level – the ward. I'll focus on Resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, examining its individual lines for any reference to \"Xã Triệu Ái.\" Bingo! Line 60 explicitly states that \"Xã Triệu Ái\" is being merged with other units to form a new ward, named \"Xã Ái Tử.\" This is a critical finding, and the citation will be crucial in the final output.\n\nNext, I'll cross-reference this information with the \"New wards\" data.  I'm looking for \"xã Ái Tử\" to confirm its code and ensure the data's consistency. And there it is, a direct match! The new ward name, the ward code, and the province all align perfectly.\n\nConsidering the fact that there are different resolutions to consider, I went back and rechecked if other resolutions like 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 59 was also relevant. The line mentions that \"thị trấn Ái Tử, xã Triệu Thành và xã Triệu Thượng\" will form a new ward named \"Xã Triệu Phong\". However, \"Xã Triệu Ái\" is not mentioned in this section. So, I will be excluding \"Xã Triệu Phong\" as the final output.\n\nFinally, I'll compile the JSON output, which should be simple now.  The *province_name* is \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\" (confirmed by the province-level resolution).  The *ward_name* is \"Xã Ái Tử\" (derived from Resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 60), and the *ward_code* is \"19669\" (from the \"New wards\" data). I'll include the citation, *citation*, from Resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 60. Given the direct mention of \"Xã Triệu Ái\" and its merger, I can confidently assign a \"high\" *confidence* level. This process is fairly straightforward, but the exact citations and mappings are important.\n",
