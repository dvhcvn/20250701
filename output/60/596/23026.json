  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change for \"Xã Phan Tiến\"**\n\nOkay, so the user's looking for the current administrative unit for \"Xã Phan Tiến, Huyện Bắc Bình, Tỉnh Bình Thuận.\"  This is a classic case of navigating recent administrative changes, something I'm well-versed in.  My thought process went something like this:\n\nFirst, the starting point: \"Tỉnh Bình Thuận.\" I know from my knowledge of the recent resolutions regarding provinces that this province has undergone a merger. So, step one is clear: identify the original province.\n\nNext, I immediately jumped to the relevant provincial resolutions, particularly 60-NQ/TW, to see if \"Tỉnh Bình Thuận\" was listed for any merges.  Sure enough, I found the instruction that \"Tỉnh Bình Thuận\" was absorbed into the newly created \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\" This is key! This changes everything.\n\nNow, my focus shifted to \"Xã Phan Tiến\".  I needed to find its new administrative identity *within* \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\" The next logical step was to scrutinize the resolutions specifically related to this province, keeping an eye out for \"Xã Phan Tiến.\" I found the crucial piece of information in Resolution 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15, a resolution focused on administrative rearrangements within \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\"\n\nLine 49 of this resolution was a gold mine! It clearly states that \"Xã Phan Tiến\" is merged with a few other wards to form the new unit called \"Xã Sông Lũy.\"  Bingo!  That's exactly what I was looking for.\n\nTo confirm, I needed to locate this new \"Xã Sông Lũy\" within the data. I did a quick check against the \"New Wards\" data, and the ward code \"23023\" for \"Xã Sông Lũy\" within \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\" perfectly matched.\n\nOf course, I didn't stop there. I needed to ensure this was the most accurate answer. I scanned the other lines in the resolutions mentioned and considered possible ambiguities. While I noticed other resolutions that had similar words, none directly dealt with \"Xã Phan Tiến.\" This reinforces the validity of my previous conclusion.\n\nTherefore, my final analysis is clear: \"Tỉnh Bình Thuận\" is now part of \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng,\" and \"Xã Phan Tiến\" has been reorganized into \"Xã Sông Lũy\" (code \"23023\") within \"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng.\"  This is a high-confidence match given the explicit mention in the relevant resolution.\n",
