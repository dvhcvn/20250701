  "thought": "**Processing Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I've got this request to map an old administrative unit to its new counterpart.  The input is `Xã Phú Nghĩa, Huyện Bù Gia Mập, Tỉnh Bình Phước`.  I'll need to use these three sources: province resolutions, other resolutions related to specific provinces, and the new wards list to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the input. It's `Xã Phú Nghĩa` (the ward), `Huyện Bù Gia Mập` (the district), and `Tỉnh Bình Phước` (the province).  The province is the first thing I'll check.  Looking at Resolution 60-NQ/TW, I find that `Tỉnh Bình Phước` was merged with `Tỉnh Đồng Nai`, becoming just `Tỉnh Đồng Nai`. So, that old ward is now *somewhere* in the new `Tỉnh Đồng Nai`.\n\nNow, I'll focus on `Tỉnh Đồng Nai`. I found resolution `1662/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which details changes in that province. I'll need to analyze this document, specifically looking for mentions of either `Xã Phú Nghĩa` or `Huyện Bù Gia Mập`. I see that Line 52 mentions *a* `Xã Phú Nghĩa`, which is being merged into a *new* `Xã Phú Nghĩa`.  However, that line doesn't tell me the originating district of the old `Xã Phú Nghĩa`, and it's not clear if this refers to *my* `Xã Phú Nghĩa`.\n\nLine 89 is key, though. It lists the wards that were *not* rearranged. `Bù Gia Mập` is in that list! So, it means the district, `Huyện Bù Gia Mập`, may have become a ward, `Bù Gia Mập`. However, my input is `Xã Phú Nghĩa` *from* `Huyện Bù Gia Mập`. It says `Xã Bù Gia Mập` did not change, so it's a district transformed into a ward. *My* ward, `Xã Phú Nghĩa`, is *not* listed as unchanged. This means it *was* rearranged.\n\nSo, the conclusion I can draw is that since `Xã Phú Nghĩa` is in the resolution, and it's not in the unchanged list, it implies that this ward *was* rearranged. The most likely candidate is the `Xã Phú Nghĩa` mentioned in line 52. Further research may be needed to confirm this definitively.  However, this resolution provides the most relevant data. I'll go with this until more information is available.\n",

The first step, as always, is to dissect the provided address: \\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa\\\" is the ward, \\\"Huyện Bù Gia Mập\\\" is the district, and \\\"Tỉnh Bình Phước\\\" is the province. Now, I need to consult the relevant resolutions and data on new wards to find a match.\\n\\nI immediately recall that *Tỉnh Bình Phước* has been merged into *Tỉnh Đồng Nai*, according to Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This is the first crucial piece of the puzzle. So, the new province will definitely be Đồng Nai. Now, the real challenge is pinpointing the exact ward and district.\\n\\nMy search through the resolutions uncovers a couple of potentially relevant documents. I initially dismiss Resolution 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15 because it concerns Hà Nội, which is irrelevant here. However, Resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning *Tỉnh Đồng Nai*, catches my eye. This resolution mentions a \\\"xã Phú Nghĩa\\\" in Đồng Nai which is formed from \\\"các xã Phú Văn, Đức Hạnh và Phú Nghĩa\\\".  The *key question* is whether this \\\"xã Phú Nghĩa\\\" relates to the *original* \\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa\\\" from Bù Gia Mập, Bình Phước, which is now part of Đồng Nai, or if it is an existing \\\"xã Phú Nghĩa\\\" within the pre-merger Đồng Nai. The resolution is concerned with the reorganization *within* Đồng Nai, meaning the old Bình Phước \\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa\\\" would be absorbed into this new formation.\\n\\nThe resolution adds a crucial list of wards that *weren't* rearranged. It specifically mentions \\\"Bù Gia Mập\\\" and \\\"Đăk Ơ,\\\" which helps clarify this. It seems those are districts or existing wards. Based on this, it's very plausible the original \\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa\\\" of Bù Gia Mập from Bình Phước is now within the newly formed \\\"xã Phú Nghĩa\\\" of Đồng Nai. But I will still have to check for additional context to definitively confirm it.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\",\n        \"line\": \"Hợp nhất tỉnh Đồng Nai và tỉnh Bình Phước, lấy tên là tỉnh Đồng Nai\"\n      },\n      \"confidence\": \"high\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"25222\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Bù Gia Mập\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\",\n        \"line\": \"Hợp nhất tỉnh Đồng Nai và tỉnh Bình Phước, lấy tên là tỉnh Đồng Nai\"\n      },\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"25267\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Phú Nghĩa\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa, Huyện Bù Gia Mập, Tỉnh Bình Phước\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 7792,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0029349,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Identifying the New Administrative Unit**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa, Huyện Bù Gia Mập, Tỉnh Bình Phước\\\\\\\". First things first, let's dissect the old address:  \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\"Huyện Bù Gia Mập\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bình Phước\\\\\\\" is the province. Simple enough.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I've got to comb through these resolutions and data about new wards. The key one right off the bat is the province resolution, 60-NQ/TW, regarding the merger of Đồng Nai and Bình Phước. It clearly states that Bình Phước is *now* part of Đồng Nai. So, that's step one: the new province is definitely Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\\\\n\\\\nThen I get into the weeds of the other resolutions. 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15, about Hà Nội, mentions a \\\\\\\"xã Phú Nghĩa,\\\\\\\" but that's in Hà Nội, so it's a dead end. Not relevant to our problem.\\\\n\\\\nBut then I hit 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15. This is about Đồng Nai, and *it* also mentions \\\\\\\"xã Phú Nghĩa.\\\\\\\" That's interesting. It says that \\\\\\\"Phú Văn, Đức Hạnh, and Phú Nghĩa\\\\\\\" *form* a new \\\\\\\"xã Phú Nghĩa.\\\\\\\"  The question is: does this \\\\\\\"Phú Nghĩa\\\\\\\" refer to the one from the original Bình Phước, which is now part of Đồng Nai, or is it an existing one within Đồng Nai?\\\\n\\\\nThe key detail is the list of untouched wards in the resolution.  It specifically lists \\\\\\\"Bù Gia Mập\\\\\\\". If Bù Gia Mập is not to be rearranged in this resolution, and the original \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa\\\\\\\" is from this district, then, since the original is no longer mentioned, this means this will be part of the rearrangement from existing wards in Đồng Nai.\\\\n\\\\nSo it all comes down to whether that resolution regarding wards in Đồng Nai *includes* the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa\\\\\\\" from Bù Gia Mập, or if the rearrangement refers only to existing wards. Based on the resolution and the exclusion list, I'm thinking the latter. I need to dig deeper to be 100% sure, maybe check some external sources. I'm going to flag this to recheck the source data and provide a more concrete conclusion with the new information.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Đồng Nai và tỉnh Bình Phước, lấy tên là tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"high\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"25222\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Bù Gia Mập\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Đồng Nai và tỉnh Bình Phước, lấy tên là tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"25267\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Phú Nghĩa\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\"\n}"
