  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a tricky mapping task: an old Vietnamese address (\"Phường Minh Long, Thị xã Chơn Thành, Tỉnh Bình Phước\") to its modern equivalent, leveraging provincial resolutions and a list of new wards.  Here's my thought process:\n\nFirst, I identified the key components: \"Phường Minh Long\" (the old ward) and \"Tỉnh Bình Phước\" (the old province). Immediately, I knew I needed to consult the provincial resolutions, specifically regarding territorial changes.  The crucial resolution I found was the one concerning the merger of Bình Phước into Đồng Nai, changing its designation.\n\nMy next step was to scrutinize the `other_resolutions`.  I homed in on resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, a specific order regarding the administrative restructuring *within* Đồng Nai (after the merger).  This was key, as it contained explicit mappings.  Line 81 explicitly states that \"Phường Minh Long\" is being merged into \"Phường Minh Hưng.\"  That's a direct connection! It’s a clean and definitive match.\n\nSimultaneously, I noted the creation of \"Phường Chơn Thành\" from other wards, which is relevant because the original address also included \"Thị xã Chơn Thành\".  However, my primary focus remained on the *specific ward* mentioned in the input address, which is \"Phường Minh Long\". This is a high-confidence association.\n\nNow, I needed to confirm these findings against the `new_wards` list.  Sure enough, I found entries for both \"Phường Minh Hưng\" and \"Phường Chơn Thành\" with the correct province, \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\"\n\nConsidering all the information, the resolution provides the necessary linkage to identify the new administrative unit for \"Phường Minh Long\".\n\nThe resolution clearly and directly merged \"Phường Minh Long\" into \"Phường Minh Hưng.\" Therefore, that is the most definitive and accurate new ward. While \"Phường Chơn Thành\" is also a new ward created as part of the broader restructuring, it is less directly relevant to answering the question about *this* given ward. The explicit merging in the resolution solidifies my high level of confidence for the answer.\n",
