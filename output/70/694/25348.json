  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Changes**\n\nOkay, so the user is asking about the new administrative unit for \"Xã Minh Đức, Huyện Hớn Quản, Tỉnh Bình Phước.\" My process is pretty straightforward, I need to figure out if there have been any changes since the original address was assigned.\n\nFirst, I know that Bình Phước province was merged, so the original province is now part of Đồng Nai province. The key here is to confirm the mergers and consolidations.\n\nNext, I need to track down specific changes affecting \"Xã Minh Đức.\"  I'm searching through the relevant resolutions, particularly those related to Đồng Nai, and since the original province is now part of Đồng Nai. I see a few mentions of \"Minh Đức\" but in other provinces. Not relevant. Then, bingo! Resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15 catches my attention because it pertains to Đồng Nai.  I zero in on the lines that mention changes in Hớn Quản district, where Minh Đức is located. I'm carefully reading through the resolution to see if \"Xã Minh Đức\" has been merged with other wards or if it's been renamed.\n\nAh, here it is! Line 42! It explicitly states that \"Xã Minh Đức\" has been formed from the merging of An Phú, Minh Tâm and Minh Đức. So, the new administrative unit is indeed \"Xã Minh Đức\". The old unit is merged and renamed with the same name. Even though the resolution doesn't explicitly mention \"Huyện Hớn Quản\" in that line, the context is clear. Since Bình Phước was merged into Đồng Nai, and Hớn Quản was a district within Bình Phước, I'm pretty confident that this is the relevant \"Xã Minh Đức\". Therefore the answer is: \"Xã Minh Đức\" remains as the new ward after the province merger.\n",
