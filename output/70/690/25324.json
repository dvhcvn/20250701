  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this administrative reorganization query, which I understand quite well given my expertise. The user's provided address is \"Phường An Lộc, Thị xã Bình Long, Tỉnh Bình Phước,\" and my task is to find the new unit.  I immediately recognize this requires checking relevant resolutions.\n\nFirst, I had to clarify the provincial context. I confirmed that \"Tỉnh Bình Phước\" has been merged with \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\" under Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This means I'm now looking for changes *within* the framework of Đồng Nai.\n\nThen, I meticulously reviewed the provided list of resolutions. Initially, the resolutions pertaining to An Giang, Cà Mau, and Đắk Lắk were irrelevant. Resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Đồng Nai, is where the relevant information resides. This is because Bình Phước is now part of Đồng Nai.\n\nWithin Resolution 1662, lines 24 and 44 weren't pertinent to the address in question. However, line 83 caught my attention: it specifically mentions \"phường An Lộc\" and merges it, along with other units, into a new ward called \"phường Bình Long.\" This seems promising, especially since the prompt emphasizes the elimination of all districts. I did note the mention of \"huyện Hớn Quản\" in the same line, but I considered this a minor detail. The key is \"phường An Lộc\" being incorporated into \"phường Bình Long\".\n\nTo confirm my finding, I cross-referenced the new ward list and found the entry: `{\"ward_code\":\"25326\",\"ward_name\":\"Phường Bình Long\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\"}` This matches perfectly!\n\nInterestingly, line 84 of the same resolution also creates a *new* \"phường An Lộc,\" though this appears to be a separate, unrelated entity. Given my initial finding, I conclude the new administrative unit for the user's provided address is likely **Phường Bình Long, Tỉnh Đồng Nai**. I am confident in this answer.\n",
