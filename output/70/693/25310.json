  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to translate the old administrative unit, \"Xã Phước Thiện, Huyện Bù Đốp, Tỉnh Bình Phước,\" to its new counterpart.  First things first, I need to break down the request. I have to delve into these resolutions, pinpoint \"Xã Phước Thiện\" (and any related areas), identify the new ward(s), assess my confidence, provide the citations, and, finally, spit out a valid JSON array.\n\nLooking at resolution 60-NQ/TW, it seems \"Tỉnh Bình Phước\" got merged into \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\" That's a key piece of the puzzle. Now I need to focus on resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one regarding administrative rearrangement within Đồng Nai. Scanning the lines, I'm hoping to see a direct mention of \"Xã Phước Thiện.\"\n\nLine 2 talks about \"Phước Thiền,\" but the context doesn't match—it's Nhơn Trạch district. Line 49 discusses districts within Bình Phước, but misses \"Xã Phước Thiện\". Then, finally, line 51 hits the mark! It explicitly states that \"Xã Phước Thiện\" and \"Xã Hưng Phước\" are merging to become the new \"Xã Hưng Phước.\" Bingo!\n\nThis is a direct hit! I’m highly confident, this is the solution. It's clear that the new ward is \"Xã Hưng Phước,\" and the resolution even confirms it's within \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\" Now, the tricky part, the ward code. I needed to cross-reference my information with that new wards list. I found \"Xã Hưng Phước\" listed under \"Tỉnh Đồng Nai,\" code 25309. Perfect.\n\nNow for the JSON construction. A single array, double-quotes all around, and all the required fields: province, ward name, ward code, confidence (high, given that direct citation), and the relevant citation detail. I'm going to format the citations with both the header and the applicable line. Then, double-checking, just to be thorough... It seems that based on the provided documents the user's request will be accurately fulfilled.\n",

The user needs the new ward(s) that correspond to \\\"Xã Phước Thiện, Huyện Bù Đốp, Tỉnh Bình Phước\\\" based on some resolutions, and they want the answer in a specific JSON format. The key here is the provided resolutions and understanding the province and ward mergers.\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the request. I've got the old ward's name and its administrative details (district and province). The primary source of truth is the resolutions. I need to output a JSON array, including a confidence level and the relevant citations.\\n\\nMy first thought is to tackle the province first. I need to figure out what happened to \\\"Tỉnh Bình Phước.\\\" Looking at Resolution 60-NQ/TW, I quickly see the merging of \\\"Tỉnh Bình Phước\\\" with \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\" to form \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\". This is significant; it narrows down my search. Any relevant new ward must be within the new province, \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\\\"\\n\\nNow, to find the specific ward mapping. I'm focusing on \\\"Other resolutions,\\\" specifically 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns \\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đồng Nai.\\\" Since Bình Phước is now part of Đồng Nai, it's relevant.\\n\\nScanning the resolution text, I find two potential leads, but I have to be careful:\\n\\n*   One mention of \\\"Phước Thiền\\\" (not \\\"Phước Thiện\\\") and a district that doesn't match.\\n\\n*   Then I found Line 51: \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Phước Thiện và xã Hưng Phước thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Hưng Phước**.\\\" This seems promising, it is about \\\"Phước Thiện\\\"! However, the resolution doesn't explicitly state the district of the old ward, which was \\\"Huyện Bù Đốp.\\\"\\n\\nTo further investigate, I looked at the list of new wards to see if there was a \\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\" in \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai,\\\" which I found.

The issue is that the resolution doesn't specify the district.\\n\\nI'll be careful because of this uncertainty. I need to be transparent about the potential ambiguity. The confidence is impacted by the lack of direct district information in the source resolution. The fact that the \\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\" is located in \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\" is good news.

First, I need to understand the goal: map the old administrative unit, \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Thiện, Huyện Bù Đốp, Tỉnh Bình Phước,\\\\\\\" to its new counterpart(s) based on the provided resolutions. I know the user wants a JSON output following a predefined schema, along with a confidence level and necessary citations.\\\\n\\\\nMy first step is to *deconstruct* the request, recognizing the elements: the old ward, the desired output, and the reliance on the resolutions as the source of truth. The key is to find the current location of \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Thiện.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNext, I *analyze* the input. The old ward's components (name, district, province) give me the starting point. I'll need to use this information to see where it has been moved to.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I *dive into the resolutions*. Starting with \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW,\\\\\\\" I need to understand what happened to \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bình Phước.\\\\\\\" This resolution clearly indicates a merger: it's now part of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\\\\\\\" This is a critical piece of information. The new ward must be within the new \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThen, I move to resolution \\\\\\\"1662/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\\\\\\" This resolution deals with the rearrangement of administrative units *within* \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\\\\\\\"  I'll need to carefully scan the lines for any mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Thiện.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nAt line 51, I find a crucial piece: \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Phước Thiện và xã Hưng Phước thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Hưng Phước**.\\\\\\\" This looks promising!  However, a slight concern arises here.  The resolution doesn't explicitly state the district of the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Thiện.\\\\\\\" The input specifies that the old ward was in \\\\\\\"Huyện Bù Đốp,\\\\\\\" but I need to be sure that the resolution refers to *this* \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Thiện.\\\\\\\" I'll cross-reference this finding with my ward database to confirm the existence of a \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI see that `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"25309\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\"}` does exist in the database.\\\\n\\\\nBased on my *synthesis*, I can see that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bình Phước\\\\\\\" merged into \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\".  According to line 51 of \\\\\\\"1662/NQ-UBTVQH15,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Thiện\\\\\\\" (and \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\") were combined to form a new ward, also named \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Phước.\\\\\\\" The ward list supports the existence of \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nWhile there is no explicit district designation in the resolution line, the association between the name \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Thiện\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\" suggests a strong possibility of correct mapping.

It's a bit of a jigsaw puzzle, but I've got a plan. First, the old address: Xã Phước Thiện (Ward Phước Thiện), Huyện Bù Đốp (Bù Đốp District), Tỉnh Bình Phước (Bình Phước Province). My goal is to figure out the new administrative units.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy initial approach is to go through the data step-by-step. First, I checked Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW), to see if Bình Phước had been merged. Bingo! The province has been merged into Đồng Nai.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen I moved to other resolutions (1662/NQ-UBTVQH15), looking specifically at how Đồng Nai's wards were reorganized. It mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in two places, in lines 1 and 3.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 1 said that part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" combined with other wards to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nhơn Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Nhơn Trạch District. However, the original address is in Bù Đốp District, which is a bit puzzling. This could mean a common ward name, or there's a district typo in the resolution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 3 is more direct, stating that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" combined with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form the new ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This seems like a clearer match, but there's no district information associated with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in this particular line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo be thorough, I cross-referenced both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nhơn Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" against the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data. Both were present, in Đồng Nai.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that the core task is to map wards, I'd lean towards prioritizing the direct match of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from line 3, while noting the district discrepancy in line 1 as a potential data issue.  My current recommendation will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Tỉnh Đồng Nai.

The initial address is: Ward: Xã Phước Thiện, District: Huyện Bù Đốp, Province: Tỉnh Bình Phước. I need to figure out where that is now.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the components: Phước Thiện (ward), Bù Đốp (district), and Bình Phước (province).  Now, I'm going to follow my plan, which begins with province resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI checked the province resolutions (60-NQ/TW). Bình Phước wasn't on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"no change\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list, but it *was* on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"merged/consolidated\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list.  Specifically, it stated that Bình Phước merged with Đồng Nai to become Đồng Nai. Alright, the province change is clear: **Tỉnh Bình Phước is now Tỉnh Đồng Nai**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I looked at other relevant resolutions (1662/NQ-UBTVQH15). This is about administrative rearrangement in Đồng Nai, so it should be key. I scanned the resolution for mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Thiện.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLine 1 caught my eye: it mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and maps a bunch of wards (Hiệp Phước, Long Tân, Phú Thạnh, Phú Hội, Phước Thiền) into a new ward: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nhơn Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It also says that Phước Thiện is in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Nhơn Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which conflicts with the input \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bù Đốp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This *could* be a typo or that my source data is incorrect and I have to choose. I'll make a note of the district discrepancy, but the ward match is strong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLine 3 is another candidate: it directly mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and merges it with another ward to create \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  No district listed here, however.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI have strong evidence for two potential matches: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nhơn Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are the likely new wards for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phước Thiện\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow I'll check my data for these new ward names in Đồng Nai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI found both wards:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nhơn Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with code 26485 and\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with code 25309.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis requires further investigation to determine which is the best fit!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Đồng Nai và tỉnh Bình Phước, lấy tên là tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"25309\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1662/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đồng Nai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"51.
