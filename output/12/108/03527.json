  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Pa Khoá\"**\n\nOkay, so the user is looking for the new administrative unit for \"Xã Pa Khoá, Huyện Sìn Hồ, Tỉnh Lai Châu.\" Straightforward enough, let's break this down. First, I need to identify the components of the address: \"Xã Pa Khoá\" is the old ward, \"Huyện Sìn Hồ\" is the old district, and \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\" is the province.  I'll start by checking the relevant resolutions and new ward data.\n\nFirst, I looked at the province level.  According to the available data, \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\" isn't being merged. This is good, it narrows things down. Then, I dug into the available resolutions.\n\nThe key resolution here is **1670/NQ-UBTVQH15**, which deals specifically with administrative reorganizations within Lai Châu.  There are a couple of relevant lines in this document. Line 19 describes the creation of \"Xã Sìn Hồ\" from a few communes, but \"Xã Pa Khoá\" isn't mentioned in that merger.  However, Line 22 is the crucial one. It explicitly states that \"Xã Pa Khóa\" (and that's the spelling variant, though it's the same place) along with \"Noong Hẻo\" and \"Pu Sam Cáp\" have been merged to form the new ward \"Xã Pu Sam Cáp.\" Bingo!\n\nI also verified my findings against the available \"New Wards\" data.  I saw a new ward with code \"03532\" and the name \"Xã Pu Sam Cáp\" listed under \"Tỉnh Lai Châu.\" That perfectly aligns with my findings from the resolution. There's another new ward, \"Xã Sìn Hồ\", but that one isn't relevant to this particular commune.\n\nSo, to summarize: \"Xã Pa Khoá\" is now part of the new ward \"Xã Pu Sam Cáp\" and the province remains the same. I'm quite confident in this answer, given the direct mention in the resolution and the corresponding new ward data. Now, I'll package this information into the required JSON format for the user.\n",
