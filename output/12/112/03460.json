  "thought": "**Insufficient Data to Determine New Ward**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with \"Xã Hua Bun, Huyện Nậm Nhùn, Tỉnh Lai Châu\" and need to find its new administrative unit. First, I break it down: \"Xã Hua Bun\" is the ward, \"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\" is the district, and \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\" is the province.\n\nSince Lai Châu hasn't merged with another province (as per Resolution 60-NQ/TW), the province name remains the same. I'm focusing on Resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with Lai Châu's commune-level administrative units. This is the relevant document.\n\nHowever, after a thorough review of Resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15, \"Xã Hua Bun\" is nowhere to be found. The resolution mentions the merger of \"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn,\" \"xã Nậm Manh,\" and \"xã Nậm Hàng\" into \"Xã Nậm Hàng,\" all within the same district (Nậm Nhùn).  But that's it.\n\nI then look at the \"New Wards\" list:  \"Xã Nậm Hàng\" and \"Xã Nậm Mạ\" are listed in Lai Châu, alongside one ward in Dien Bien. While both are in the correct province, there is no direct link to \"Xã Hua Bun\".  The prompt stated that districts are being eliminated and most wards are renamed/split/merged, but *some* are kept unchanged.  I can't say for sure whether \"Xã Hua Bun\" was changed, merged into the new \"Xã Nậm Hàng\" (which includes *other* wards), renamed, or remains as is. Since the text provides no information about it, I must indicate that I cannot determine a new ward. My output will be an empty array as a response, signifying no mapping can be confirmed.\n",

The user's request is pretty straightforward: find the new administrative unit for \\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\" in \\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn,\\\" \\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu.\\\" That's the starting point.\\n\\nFirst, the input analysis confirmed the key pieces of information. \\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\", \\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\\\", and \\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\". \\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\" is not slated for any province-level merger, according to the confirmation provided. Now, the main challenge is piecing together what happened within that province, specifically in that district.\\n\\nI then dug into the Resolutions. Quickly ruled out 1661 (Điện Biên). Then, Resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15 focused on \\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\". This is where things got interesting. I noted the merger of \\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn\\\", \\\"xã Nậm Manh\\\", and \\\"xã Nậm Hàng\\\" into the new \\\"xã Nậm Hàng.\\\" However, my concern is that this resolution *doesn't* mention \\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\".\\n\\nNext, I reviewed the new ward list. I immediately dismissed \\\"Xã Nà Hỳ\\\" in Điện Biên. \\\"Xã Nậm Hàng\\\" from the provided new ward list relates to the merger discussed in Resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15. No help for my original unit. \\\"Xã Nậm Mạ\\\" is also listed, but it is not mentioned in any resolutions.\\n\\nHere's the rub: While I have a decent grasp of broader provincial-level changes, including which provinces haven't been affected and the one merger in the region, I have a big blind spot. The provided information does *not* provide details on how the old \\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\\\" has been reorganized beyond the specific merger of the wards mentioned. There is no mapping, and, as stated in the instructions, low confidence is warranted here. I am therefore unable to provide the user with a definitive answer. The results suggest the input unit will map to a null/non match.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Hua Bun, Huyện Nậm Nhùn, Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 8196,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0026637999999999996,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Analysis of Administrative Unit Changes for \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun, Huyện Nậm Nhùn, Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\\\\\"**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so the user wants to identify the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun, Huyện Nậm Nhùn, Tỉnh Lai Châu.\\\\\\\" Let's break this down systematically. First, the province. I know from my expertise in these matters and a quick scan of the \\\\\\\"Province resolutions\\\\\\\" that Lai Châu (Tỉnh Lai Châu) isn't slated for any mergers. That's good. Now, the real challenge is finding what happened to \\\\\\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\" and specifically \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nI'll check the provided resolutions, starting with \\\\\\\"Other resolutions.\\\\\\\" I see a resolution for Điện Biên, which I can quickly disregard. Then there's \\\\\\\"1670/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Lai Châu.\\\\\\\" Excellent. This is the relevant one. Reading through it, I find a mention of \\\\\\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\" being merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Hàng.\\\\\\\" Now, that's interesting because the address specifically asks about \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\", not \\\\\\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\". It is key to understand \\\\\\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\" is just one ward (or equivalent) in the district. So, while this resolution addresses changes within Huyện Nậm Nhùn, it's not directly applicable to \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nNext, I turned my attention to the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" data for Lai Châu. I see \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Hàng\\\\\\\" listed as a new ward, which is consistent with the merger mentioned in 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15. However, there's no corresponding information about \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\" in the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" data or linked to the said resolution. There is another, \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Mạ,\\\\\\\" listed, but with no supporting resolution provided to understand how it relates to \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, based on the information provided, it's clear that \\\\\\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\" no longer exists as a district. The only specific merger I found regarding wards *within* this district addresses *another* ward, \\\\\\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\", not \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun.\\\\\\\" Unfortunately, there's no explicit resolution or data that directly maps \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\" to a new administrative unit. I'd need further data to be certain of what has happened to \\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\", as its new designation is *not* provided within the provided materials.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"3.

First thing's first, I glance at the province resolutions. Lai Châu is explicitly *not* being merged or reorganized at the provincial level, according to 60-NQ/TW. Good, that simplifies things. The province remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I dive into the more granular data. I'm looking for any mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the provided resolutions and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" information. The first resolution, 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, is a dead end; it concerns Điện Biên, not Lai Châu. But 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15 is promising. It deals specifically with Lai Châu.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's where it gets interesting: the resolution details the merging of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nậm Manh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nậm Hàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to create \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Hàng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Crucially, it mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - a ward within the district - not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It tells me the district, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", doesn't exist anymore. I know \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a district level, while \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a ward level. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a different ward level unit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nChecking the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data reveals \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Hàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (code 03434) in Lai Châu, which aligns with the merger detailed in 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15. However, there's no connection drawn between \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and this new ward. There's also \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Mạ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (code 03538), but again, no explanation for its emergence or relevance to my target address.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe critical piece of the puzzle is this: the provided data *does not* specify what happens to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It tells me \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is gone and that a different ward was merged. But I have no definitive answer for the specific ward in question. The resolutions cover \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Nậm Nhùn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Hàng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but they fall short on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Based on the data available, there's no clear, direct mapping. I need more information to definitively pinpoint the new ward for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hua Bun.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"3.
