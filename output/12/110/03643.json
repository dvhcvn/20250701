  "thought": "**Analysis of Vietnamese Address Mapping for Administrative Restructuring**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal here is to accurately map an old Vietnamese address (\"Xã Khoen On\", \"Huyện Than Uyên\", \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\") to the new administrative units, given the provided resolutions and new ward data.\n\nFirst, I identified the components: \"Xã Khoen On\" is the old ward, \"Huyện Than Uyên\" is the old district (though the prompt mentioned we're eliminating districts, this context is still helpful), and \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\" is the old province.\n\nNext, I consulted Province Resolutions 60-NQ/TW.  I found \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\" listed under units *not* undergoing mergers. So, the province name essentially remains unchanged.\n\nThen, I shifted to other resolutions, specifically 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15, to see how the wards were being affected. Line 2 immediately caught my eye: it states that \"Xã Khoen On\" (the old one) was merged with \"xã Ta Gia\" to form a *new* \"Xã Khoen On\".  Crucially, the name remains the same, but it's a new entity.\n\nLine 3 is also relevant, though indirectly. It talks about \"Xã Than Uyên\" being formed from other units within \"Huyện Than Uyên\". Because the old address included \"Huyện Than Uyên\", I had to consider if the old \"Xã Khoen On\" might be *part* of this new \"Xã Than Uyên\".  However, the resolution is quite clear: \"Xã Khoen On\" is explicitly transformed into \"Xã Khoen On.\"  The \"Xã Than Uyên\" resolution does *not* mention \"Xã Khoen On.\" This suggests they are distinct reorganizations.\n\nWith the new ward data, I see: \"Xã Than Uyên,\" \"Xã Mường Than,\" and, importantly, \"Xã Khoen On\" (the new one).  Given resolution line 2, mapping the *old* \"Xã Khoen On\" to the *new* \"Xã Khoen On\" is the definitive match.  The other wards are unrelated in this scenario.\n\nFinally, constructing the JSON output is straightforward: the primary match is \"Xã Khoen On\" (old) -> \"Xã Khoen On\" (new).  The province remains \"Tỉnh Lai Châu.\"  My confidence in this mapping is high because the resolution directly addresses the fate of the old ward, explicitly linking it to the new ward with the same name. It's a clean and clear transformation, though the district context required a moment of consideration.\n",
