  "thought": "**Analyzing the Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a request to map an old administrative unit, specifically `Xã Tông Qua Lìn` in `Huyện Phong Thổ, Tỉnh Lai Châu`, to a new one. The user has provided resolutions which I need to analyze. My initial thought process involves a structured approach:\n\nFirst, I need to thoroughly understand the provided input. This means meticulously examining the old administrative unit, the list of resolutions (`60-NQ/TW`, `1670/NQ-UBTVQH15`, and `1687/NQ-UBTVQH15`), and the possible new wards.\n\nNext, I'll perform a step-by-step mapping process. I know the old unit is in `Tỉnh Lai Châu`. According to `60-NQ/TW`, Lai Châu hasn't undergone province-level changes, so that's straightforward. The user also mentions district elimination. Thus, `Huyện Phong Thổ` is gone. Now comes the trickier part: the ward level.\n\nI'll check the resolutions for any mention of `Xã Tông Qua Lìn`. Resolution `1670/NQ-UBTVQH15` covers `Tỉnh Lai Châu`. While it mentions `thị trấn Phong Thổ` being merged into a new `xã Phong Thổ`, it doesn't mention `Xã Tông Qua Lìn`. Resolution `1687/NQ-UBTVQH15` is irrelevant as it pertains to `Tỉnh Vĩnh Long`.\n\nI'll synthesize my findings. The province is unchanged, the district is gone, and the specific old ward isn't in the provided resolutions. Therefore, I can't determine its new location with certainty. The most accurate response is an empty list, `[]`.  The user implicitly asked me to search for candidates, and none were identified. This aligns with the instruction to return an empty array if no mapping is possible.\n",

I've got to map an old ward, specifically \\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn, Huyện Phong Thổ, Tỉnh Lai Châu,\\\" to its new counterpart based on these resolutions.\\n\\nFirst, I break down the input. I have the old ward details, province resolutions outlining mergers (or lack thereof), and other resolutions that deal with ward-level changes. There's also a list of the new wards.\\n\\nI immediately check the province. \\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\" is listed in the province resolutions as *not* being merged. So, at least the province stays the same, which is consistent with the general pattern.\\n\\nNext, I dig into the ward-level resolutions. I'm looking for mentions of \\\"Tông Qua Lìn\\\" or \\\"Phong Thổ.\\\" Resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Lai Châu, is the key one. It describes the formation of a new \\\"Xã Phong Thổ\\\" by merging \\\"thị trấn Phong Thổ,\\\" \\\"Huổi Luông,\\\" \\\"Ma Li Pho,\\\" and \\\"Mường So.\\\" It's definitely relevant, but critically, **\\\"Tông Qua Lìn\\\" is NOT mentioned**. The other resolution is about Vĩnh Long, so I can discard that one.\\n\\nI'm synthesizing this. The province is unchanged. The resolutions show a new \\\"Xã Phong Thổ,\\\" but the old ward isn't directly included.  The user also states that all districts are eliminated, and that the old ward was in `Huyện Phong Thổ`.  I have to keep in mind, however, that while a new `Xã Phong Thổ` is mentioned, the exact fate of `Xã Tông Qua Lìn` within the eliminated district is unclear.\\n\\nBased on the *provided* information, I can't definitively link \\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\" to a new ward. It's possible it was merged into the new \\\"Phong Thổ\\\" and omitted from the resolution's list, or perhaps into a ward not mentioned in the information.\\n\\nMy output needs to reflect this. The prompt specifies identifying *possible* candidates when information is limited, with low confidence. Given the current state, my result has to be an empty array or something with very low confidence, because while it is possible that the ward has been absorbed, there is no hard evidence to make the conclusion with certainty. The user's prompt is to identify *possible* candidates, so the only clue is the district name, `Huyện Phong Thổ`.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lai Châu\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn, Huyện Phong Thổ, Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 8523,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0028039000000000002,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Assessment of the Address Mapping Request**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's my thought process on this address mapping problem. The user wants me to link an old address (\\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\\\\\") to a new administrative unit, based on these resolutions and a list of new wards.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the old ward and province, which were straightforward. Then, I dug into the provided resolutions, specifically looking for mentions of \\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Huyện Phong Thổ,\\\\\\\" since that's where I would expect to find clues about its fate.\\\\n\\\\nThe province, \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu,\\\\\\\" appears on the list of provinces *not* undergoing any mergers according to the 60-NQ/TW resolution, so that aspect is easy.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, when I went through resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15, I found the creation of \\\\\\\"Xã Phong Thổ\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\"thị trấn Phong Thổ\\\\\\\" and a few other wards. The crucial point is that \\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\" *isn't* mentioned in that specific resolution. The resolution *does* relate to the district \\\\\\\"Huyện Phong Thổ,\\\\\\\" but the resolution specifies a subset of wards, not all of them.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I examined the new ward data. There's a \\\\\\\"Xã Phong Thổ\\\\\\\" identified, but that's based on the merger of other, specific wards, so that data point is useless for me here.\\\\n\\\\nSince \\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\" isn't referenced in any relevant resolutions, I'm at an impasse. There isn't enough information to map it to any *specific* new ward. The user specified that most wards were changed; but without more information, I can't be sure if \\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\" was: renamed, split, merged elsewhere, or remained unchanged.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, because of this lack of information, I have to conclude that my confidence is \\\\\\\"low,\\\\\\\" and I can't provide a direct mapping. The only useful citation I have is resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15, but it doesn't mention the old ward in question. The \\\\\\\"correct\\\\\\\" response is to flag this as needing additional research.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"1.

My initial assessment is that I don't have enough data to give a confident answer. Here's my thought process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the old ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") and province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). I confirmed that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I scrutinized the provided resolutions, looking specifically for any mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Phong Thổ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I found Resolution 1670/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns Lai Châu's administrative adjustments. This resolution creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phong Thổ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the merger of `thị trấn Phong Thổ`, `Huổi Luông`, `Ma Li Pho`, and `Mường So`. However, *crucially*, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* mentioned in this resolution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, I checked the provided new ward information: `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"03549\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phong Thổ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`. While this appears to be a new ward, it's explicitly created from the listed wards and *doesn't* include \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe main issue here is the limited scope of the resolutions I have. The prompt states that most wards have changed, but a few are unchanged. Without information on what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I'm forced to conclude that a direct mapping is impossible. It could be unchanged, merged into another ward not mentioned, or renamed entirely.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the uncertainty, my confidence level must be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I can't definitively assign \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tông Qua Lìn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new ward based on the current data. I'll flag this as needing further investigation and specify the relevant resolution (1670/NQ-UBTVQH15) that provides context, even though it doesn't directly address this specific ward. It's a matter of covering my bases.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1.
