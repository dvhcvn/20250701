  "thought": "**My Analysis of Address Mapping for \"Xã Liêm Sơn, Huyện Thanh Liêm, Tỉnh Hà Nam\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with mapping this old address to its current administrative units. The key here is to leverage the provided resolutions and new ward data to perform this transformation.\n\nFirst, I identified the original province and ward: \"Tỉnh Hà Nam\" and \"Xã Liêm Sơn,\" respectively. Straight away, I know I'll be dealing with potential changes due to the province merger.\n\nI started by consulting Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which outlined the mergers and consolidations.  I found that \"Tỉnh Hà Nam\" was, indeed, merged into \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình.\" That's the first critical piece.  High confidence in this finding, as it's a direct statement in a major resolution.\n\nNext, I delved into the other relevant resolutions, specifically looking for any mentions of \"Xã Liêm Sơn.\"  And Bingo! Resolution 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning the restructuring of wards within \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình,\" explicitly stated that \"Xã Liêm Sơn\" was being combined with other wards to form a new ward called \"**xã Thanh Bình**.\"  This is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThis resolution confirms the province name alignment as it is under \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\".  I'm increasingly confident in this mapping.\n\nNow, I needed to locate the corresponding \"ward_code\" and confirm the \"province_name\" from the \"New wards\" data.  The match was clear: \"Xã Thanh Bình\" in the resolutions corresponded to the record with the matching `{\"ward_code\":\"13483\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Thanh Bình\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\"}`. This final piece confirmed the province name.\n\nGiven the explicit nature of the resolutions and the clear mapping from old to new units, I'd rate this a high confidence mapping.\n\nTherefore, my final JSON output would be structured with these details, with the primary citation referencing the key resolution that mentioned the original address, `1674/NQ-UBTVQH15`.\n",
