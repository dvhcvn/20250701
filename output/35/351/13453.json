  "thought": "**My Analysis of \"Xã Thanh Hà, Huyện Thanh Liêm, Tỉnh Hà Nam\"**\n\nOkay, here's the situation: I'm trying to figure out what the new administrative designation is for the old address \"Xã Thanh Hà, Huyện Thanh Liêm, Tỉnh Hà Nam\".  My process is pretty standard for this type of query, and the key is a systematic approach.\n\nFirst, I identified the original province, \"Tỉnh Hà Nam\".  That's a good starting point. Then, I needed to check for any province mergers or name changes, and here's where the *resolutions* come in.  Looking at Resolution 60-NQ/TW, it's clear that Hà Nam *did* undergo a merger: it's now part of Ninh Bình.\n\nSo, \"Tỉnh Hà Nam\" effectively became \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\".  Important change.\n\nNext, I needed to pin down the *ward* -  \"Xã Thanh Hà\". Now, the tricky part is cross-referencing this against other resolutions to see if \"Xã Thanh Hà\" was affected by any restructuring. I had to sift through a lot of them, specifically looking for mentions of \"Thanh Hà\" within the context of Hà Nam or Ninh Bình.\n\nI ran into a few possibilities early on, but they all turned out to be red herrings. For example, some resolutions mentioned \"Thanh Hà\" but they were in different provinces entirely (like Bắc Ninh and Đà Nẵng).  These were quickly dismissed.\n\nI paid close attention to detail, carefully noting the *type* of administrative unit mentioned (phường, xã, etc.) and the province association. I had to look into the specifics of *Hải Phòng's* resolution, as it mentioned a \"Thị trấn Thanh Hà\" and a \"huyện Thanh Hà\". That seemed promising, but ultimately, it didn't pertain to our \"Xã Thanh Hà\" situation in Hà Nam/Ninh Bình. The district names were different.\n\nEssentially, after going through these resolutions, I haven't found a direct match for \"Xã Thanh Hà, Huyện Thanh Liêm, Tỉnh Hà Nam.\" It hasn't been merged with other wards or changed its name, according to the information available. I think further research, potentially involving a deeper dive into local Hà Nam / Ninh Bình records, is necessary. The resolutions alone haven't given me a definitive answer.\n",
