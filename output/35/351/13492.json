  "thought": "**Address Mapping Analysis: Xã Thanh Tâm, Huyện Thanh Liêm, Tỉnh Hà Nam**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user's goal is clear: they're asking me to find the modern administrative equivalent of this old address in Vietnam.  I've got the old address components: Xã Thanh Tâm, Huyện Thanh Liêm, Tỉnh Hà Nam. My task is to map this to the current system, utilizing resolutions and a list of new wards.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the historical context.  I'll start with the province: Tỉnh Hà Nam.  I'm familiar with Resolution 60-NQ/TW, and it clearly states a merger.  Hà Nam, along with Ninh Bình and Nam Định, *became* Ninh Bình.  That's a high-confidence province change.\n\nNext, the critical part: the ward, Xã Thanh Tâm.  I'm looking closely at the other resolutions, and I immediately spot it in Resolution 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15. Bingo! This resolution explicitly states that Xã Thanh Tâm is being *merged* with others to form Xã Thanh Liêm.  The title of the resolution also mentions Ninh Bình, confirming the province match. This is another high-confidence match.\n\nNow, I'll cross-reference this information with the list of *New wards*.  I need to verify that Xã Thanh Liêm exists in Ninh Bình.  And there it is: a perfect match!  The code, the name, and the province are all aligned.\n\nConcerning the district, Huyện Thanh Liêm, while the original address includes it, the overall reform eliminated that layer, focusing on the higher administrative units. The critical mapping is from the old *ward* to the *new ward* in a new *province*.\n\nTherefore, I'll construct my JSON output based on these resolutions.  The *citation* will include 60-NQ/TW for the province merger and 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15 for the ward merger. My *confidence* will be high because both key changes are explicitly stated and verified.  The *province_name* will be Tỉnh Ninh Bình, the *ward_code* will be 13495, and the *ward_name* will be Xã Thanh Liêm.\n\nFinally, I'm confident about the high level of accuracy. The province and the ward transformations are both explicitly stated and cross-verified, and the final new ward data is also accurate.\n",
