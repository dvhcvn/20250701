My goal is to determine the new administrative unit(s) for the old ward \"Xã Phú Thuận B, Huyện Hồng Ngự, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\". As a specialist, I need to methodically approach this.\n\nFirst, I identified the key information: the province, district, and ward. Then, I dug into the core of the problem: the province restructuring resolution (60-NQ/TW). Fortunately, Đồng Tháp didn't change its name, so that was straightforward.\n\nNext, I turned my attention to Resolution 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key document regarding administrative adjustments in Đồng Tháp. And this is where things became clear. Line 7 states that part of \"Xã Phú Thuận B\" was combined with other wards to form the new ward, \"Xã Long Phú Thuận\". I confirmed this by finding \"Xã Long Phú Thuận\" in the `New wards` data.\n\nFurther down, Line 17 of the same resolution proved crucial. It detailed the allocation of the *remaining* portion of \"Xã Phú Thuận B\" into a new ward called \"Xã Tân Long.\"  Again, a quick check of the `New wards` data confirmed its existence.\n\nThe other resolution, 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, was for a different province and thus irrelevant.\n\nTherefore, my conclusive analysis is that \"Xã Phú Thuận B\" has been partitioned: a section into \"Xã Long Phú Thuận\" and the remaining portion into \"Xã Tân Long.\" Both these changes are confirmed within Resolution 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15. I'm ready to craft the appropriate JSON output to represent these findings.\n",

The user's looking for the new administrative units for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Thuận B\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Hồng Ngự district, Đồng Tháp province. My process is pretty straightforward, but requires careful attention to detail, especially when dealing with split wards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I confirmed that Đồng Tháp remains intact as a province, no mergers there. That's from the initial check of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I zeroed in on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" focusing on Đồng Tháp, specifically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1663/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is where things get interesting. Line 7 states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Thuận B\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *partially* merged to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Thuận\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Then, in line 17, it explicitly notes that the *remaining* part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Thuận B\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis split is the key. I cross-referenced these findings with my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list, confirming that both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú Thuận\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are indeed new wards in Đồng Tháp: {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"29992\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú Thuận\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"} and {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"30154\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"} respectively.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow comes the tricky part: confidence.  The resolutions clearly show a split. Without further location data within the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Thuận B\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", I *cannot* definitively state which new ward encompasses the *entire* old address. It's either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú Thuận\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", or parts of both. Therefore, a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" confidence level is warranted here. I simply don't have enough granular information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, the JSON output needs to reflect this ambiguity:  I'll generate two JSON objects - one for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú Thuận\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and one for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Long\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", each citing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1663/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the source and specifying \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" confidence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1663/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"7.
