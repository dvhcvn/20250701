  "thought": "**Processing the Administrative Unit Reorganization**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to find the new administrative unit for \"Xã Tân Nghĩa, Huyện Cao Lãnh, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\". My first thought is to break down the address: Ward: Xã Tân Nghĩa, District: Huyện Cao Lãnh, and Province: Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\n\nThe key here is the user's information about districts being eliminated. That immediately tells me I need to look for mergers or name changes at the district level. I check for province changes.  Good news! The province name \"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\" seems to be unchanged based on document 60-NQ/TW, which says that the merger was Tiền Giang into Đồng Tháp, which they just kept the name of.\n\nNow I'll dig through the relevant resolutions for any mentions of \"Xã Tân Nghĩa\" and \"Huyện Cao Lãnh\". I start with Resolution 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15. I am looking line by line.\n\n*   Bingo! Line 96 of Resolution 1663 directly mentions \"Xã Tân Nghĩa\"! It clearly states that \"Xã Tân Nghĩa\" is merged with \"phường Mỹ Ngãi\" and \"xã Mỹ Tân (thành phố Cao Lãnh)\" to form a new unit named \"phường Mỹ Ngãi\". Perfect!\n\nI also quickly look through the other resolution, 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15, to make sure there are no conflicts.  There are mentions of \"Tân Nghĩa\", but they are in Lâm Đồng province, so they are not relevant.\n\nMy final check: I need to verify that \"phường Mỹ Ngãi\" is present and that everything aligns with my data structure. I found the match, and everything is in order. My conclusion is that \"Xã Tân Nghĩa\" has become \"phường Mỹ Ngãi\".\n",

First, I identify the old ward and province: \\\"Xã Tân Nghĩa\\\" and \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\", respectively. Checking for province mergers, it seems Đồng Tháp stayed the same. Now, the key is the ward mapping.\\n\\nI dove into the resolutions, focusing on Đồng Tháp. Resolution 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically line 96, is crucial. It mentions \\\"xã Tân Nghĩa\\\" from \\\"thành phố Cao Lãnh\\\" being merged into the new \\\"phường Mỹ Ngãi.\\\" Bingo! This seems like a solid match. Then, cross-referencing this against the provided \\\"New wards\\\" list for \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp,\\\" I confirmed that \\\"phường Mỹ Ngãi\\\" indeed exists as a new ward.\\n\\nMy confidence is high. The resolution explicitly states the merge. However, a slight wrinkle emerges: the input address specifies \\\"Huyện Cao Lãnh\\\" while the resolution cites \\\"thành phố Cao Lãnh.\\\" This detail needs careful consideration. It's plausible \\\"Huyện Cao Lãnh\\\" might have been restructured, or the source data may not perfectly align with the resolutions. Further checking didn't reveal any other \\\"Tân Nghĩa\\\" in Đồng Tháp resolutions.\\n\\nIn summary, I'm leaning toward mapping \\\"Xã Tân Nghĩa, Huyện Cao Lãnh, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\" to \\\"Phường Mỹ Ngãi,\\\" *with the caveat regarding the \\\"Huyện\\\" and \\\"Thành phố\\\" difference*. Further clarification on Cao Lãnh's district-level changes could eliminate the ambiguity.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1663/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đồng Tháp\",\n        \"line\": \"96.

First, I identify the components: \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Nghĩa\\\\\\\" is the ward, and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\" is the province. Now, I need to check for any province mergers. Luckily, the \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\" resolution confirms that Đồng Tháp remained as \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp,\\\\\\\" so no changes there.\\\\n\\\\nNext, the real work begins. I'm searching for \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Nghĩa\\\\\\\" in the relevant resolutions. Bingo! Resolution \\\\\\\"1663/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\\\\\" is my key. Line 96 explicitly states that \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Nghĩa\\\\\\\" is merged with other units to form \\\\\\\"phường Mỹ Ngãi.\\\\\\\" This looks promising!\\\\n\\\\nNow, to cross-reference with my \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" list for Đồng Tháp. And there it is: `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"29884\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Ngãi\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\"}` perfectly matches the new ward. The evidence strongly suggests \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Nghĩa\\\\\\\" now belongs to \\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Ngãi.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHowever, I'm noting a crucial point. The original address specifies \\\\\\\"Huyện Cao Lãnh,\\\\\\\" while the resolution refers to \\\\\\\"thành phố Cao Lãnh.\\\\\\\" This is a bit of a wrinkle. I'm thinking, given the context of administrative restructuring, it's possible that \\\\\\\"Huyện Cao Lãnh\\\\\\\" might have been absorbed into \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cao Lãnh,\\\\\\\" or that \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Nghĩa\\\\\\\" was moved to \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cao Lãnh.\\\\\\\" I don't have enough information to confirm that, and it's a slight ambiguity I need to be aware of. I should also check if the \\\\\\\"Hàm Tân\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lâm Đồng\\\\\\\" is relevant. It is not.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, my analysis leads me to conclude that \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Nghĩa, Huyện Cao Lãnh, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\" *likely* corresponds to \\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Ngãi, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp,\\\\\\\" but I must flag the \\\\\\\"Huyện Cao Lãnh\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cao Lãnh\\\\\\\" discrepancy as a potential issue, depending on the need for absolute specificity.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1663/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"96.
