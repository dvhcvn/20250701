  "thought": "**Identifying the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Định An, Huyện Lấp Vò, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\"**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My analysis started by verifying that \"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\" is still a valid province name, which it is, although it now encompasses parts of the former Tiền Giang province.  Then, I scoured the relevant resolutions, focusing on \"Định An,\" \"Lấp Vò,\" and \"Đồng Tháp.\"  Initially, I found mentions of \"Định An\" in other provinces, like An Giang, Vĩnh Long and TPHCM, but these were quickly dismissed as mismatches.\n\nThe crucial clue came from Resolution 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15 concerning Đồng Tháp. Line 32 of this resolution states that \"xã Định An\" is merged into the new \"xã Lai Vung.\"  However, and this is where it gets tricky, the resolution mentions the merger of wards from \"huyện Lai Vung\", while the input specifies \"Huyện Lấp Vò.\" This creates an immediate ambiguity: is this the *same* \"Định An\" from Lấp Vò, or a different one within Đồng Tháp?\n\nDigging deeper, I re-examined the resolution and confirmed that the lines dealing with Lấp Vò wards (lines 29 and 31) don't mention \"Định An.\" This suggests that \"xã Định An\" in line 32 might be a different administrative unit altogether, perhaps from \"Huyện Lai Vung\" rather than Lấp Vò.  However, these new resolutions can sometimes consolidate units across boundaries and it is plausible that a unit from different districts could be merged into the same new unit.\n\nTherefore, \"Xã Lai Vung\" is a *possible* candidate, as it is the only \"Định An\" merge I found in the correct province. The  fact that districts are sometimes being eliminated makes the merging possible. However, given the district discrepancy, my confidence is low. I'll flag this clearly.\n",

First, I'll break down the information I have: the old ward, district, and province. The province hasn't changed, thankfully, so \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\" is still correct. The main challenge is finding out what happened to \\\"Xã Định An\\\" and which new entity it belongs to now.\\n\\nMy initial approach is to check province resolutions, specifically those related to administrative changes.

It's a match regarding the province and the ward name! However, the input I have specifies \\\"Huyện Lấp Vò\\\" as the district. This resolution combines \\\"Xã Định An\\\" with wards from \\\"Huyện Lai Vung\\\". I'm not entirely confident in this solution. Maybe there are two \\\"Xã Định An\\\"? Or perhaps the resolution's district information is incomplete. I need to make sure I don't jump to any hasty conclusions. The new ward list should hopefully clear things up.\\n\\nI also checked resolutions from other provinces: Ninh Bình, Hồ Chí Minh, and Vĩnh Long. No luck there.\\n\\nI've got a strong lead on \\\"Xã Lai Vung,\\\" but I need to confirm the district. My confidence level is medium right now.

I need to figure out the current administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I quickly checked the provincial mergers (Resolution 60-NQ/TW) and confirmed that Đồng Tháp is still Đồng Tháp, even with its historical merger with Tiền Giang.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the real work starts. I need to sift through all the relevant province resolutions, specifically looking for changes affecting wards and districts.  I'm reading each line carefully, searching for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and noting the surrounding context to confirm if it matches my input address's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI ran through the resolutions meticulously:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n*   Resolution 1654 (An Giang) mentions a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Định An,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but it's clearly for a different province and context, so that's a no-go.\\\\\\\\n*   Resolution 1663 (Đồng Tháp) is a strong candidate since it's the right province.  I found line 32, which merges \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lai Vung.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, a bit of ambiguity crept in. While the resolution mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Lai Vung,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" it doesn't explicitly link \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to that district. This raises a slight concern, but it's the most promising lead.\\\\\\\\n*   The other resolutions (1674 Ninh Bình, 1685 Hồ Chí Minh, and 1687 Vĩnh Long) don't apply, as they are from different provinces.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the potential match in Resolution 1663, I'm leaning towards \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lai Vung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the new administrative unit.  To confirm, I double-checked the list of new wards, and, yes, there is an entry for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lai Vung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Therefore, based on my analysis, I believe the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An, Huyện Lấp Vò, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is likely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lai Vung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Đồng Tháp province.** I am confident in this finding, but I will make a note of the ambiguity in the original resolution.

Thankfully, Resolution 60-NQ/TW doesn't change anything for Đồng Tháp; it confirms that the province remains as is.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I dove into the relevant resolutions, particularly those related to Đồng Tháp. Resolution 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15 caught my eye.  Several lines detail administrative changes, but it's line 32 that's crucial.  It states: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Tân Thành và xã Tân Phước (huyện Lai Vung), xã Định An, xã Định Yên thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Lai Vung.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Bingo!

The resolution lists the other wards by district, such as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Thành và xã Tân Phước (huyện Lai Vung)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The absence of a district for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is peculiar. It suggests that while they are being merged with others to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lai Vung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", they might not necessarily belong to Huyện Lai Vung or Huyện Lấp Vò.  This means \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" could be from any district in Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConsidering the input address specified \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Lấp Vò\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", while the resolution doesn't specify it, it makes it highly likely this is the correct \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is a tricky one.

My initial steps are clear: first, identify the province and ward. Then, I need to consult relevant resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe province is straightforward: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on the province merging resolution, 60-NQ/TW. No change there.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, focusing on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", I've meticulously checked the relevant resolutions, particularly those related to province reorganization (60-NQ/TW) and specifically, Resolution 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Đồng Tháp. My thorough review highlighted a key passage in line 32: It mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being merged to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lai Vung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, the resolution specifically calls out the districts for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but *not* for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Định Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This absence of a district designation raises a flag.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe original address specifies \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Lấp Vò,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" meaning the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is from that district. My assumption was that because the resolution is for Đồng Tháp, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mentioned in the resolution would also be in Đồng Tháp, and likely in Lấp Vò. But the phrasing of the resolution creates ambiguity. Because the districts of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tân Thành và Tân Phước\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are clarified, but the districts of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Định An and Định Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are not, I must assume that the resolution is not clear on the district.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI've examined other resolutions, but they're not relevant. Thus, as a conclusion, based on the best available information, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lai Vung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". But because the resolution does not specifically clarify if the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Định An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lai Vung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is from Lấp Vò, there is ambiguity as to if this is the correct information. Further clarification of district of origin may be required to confirm this is the correct new ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Tiền Giang và tỉnh Đồng Tháp, lấy tên là tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"30226\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lai Vung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1663/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"32.
