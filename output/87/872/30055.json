My task is to figure out the current administrative unit corresponding to the old \"Xã Mỹ Quý\" in Đồng Tháp province. Here's my thought process:\n\nFirst, I identified the key components: the old ward \"Xã Mỹ Quý,\" the district \"Huyện Tháp Mười,\" and the province \"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\"  Province is straightforward, based on the merger history, it remains \"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\"\n\nNext, I delved into the provided resolutions to see if I could find any mention of \"Xã Mỹ Quý.\"  I scanned the relevant resolutions, particularly those related to Đồng Tháp, but came up empty-handed.  I confirmed the other districts in Huyện Tháp Mười also had changes based on these resolutions.\n\nI then consulted the list of new wards for Đồng Tháp.  No \"Xã Mỹ Quý\" there.  The new ward listings show the new \"Xã Tháp Mười\", \"Xã Phương Thịnh\" were created but without any reference to \"Xã Mỹ Quý\". There also seemed to be an apparent contradiction in the resolutions and the list of new wards which needed a revisit.\n\nBased on my analysis of the provided data, I'm left with a distinct lack of information. \"Xã Mỹ Quý\" simply isn't mentioned. It wasn't explicitly renamed or merged in any of the resolutions.  It could have been unchanged, or it may have been subject to a change covered in a resolution I don't have access to.\n\nGiven the lack of definitive information, I must conclude that I cannot confidently map \"Xã Mỹ Quý\" to a specific new administrative unit.  I'll indicate low confidence in my response, along with the province name for context.  It's the only honest and accurate conclusion based on the available data.\n",

My goal is to determine the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý, Huyện Tháp Mười, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\" I'm an expert in this, so here's my thought process:\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to analyze the input. We're starting with \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"Huyện Tháp Mười,\\\\\\\" within the province of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\" I know that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\" has undergone changes based on resolution 60-NQ/TW, with the merger of Tiền Giang and Đồng Tháp. While the province name remains the same, it's a larger entity now.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to check the relevant province-level resolutions and resolutions about ward and commune level changes. I'll focus on the resolutions that mention \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\".\\\\nI checked resolution 1654/NQ-UBTVQH15, which mentions \\\\\\\"Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\" but it's in a different province, An Giang, and is not a match.\\\\nResolution 1663/NQ-UBTVQH15 does address \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\" Unfortunately, after carefully examining each line, it doesn't mention \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý.\\\\\\\"  I continued to check other resolutions related to other provinces but found no mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI also need to check the list of potential \\\\\\\"New Wards.\\\\\\\" The problem states that districts are eliminated and some wards are kept unchanged. It's possible that \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\" was retained but with a new code.\\\\nI then cross-referenced this list with any wards named \\\\\\\"Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\" or similar in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\" I found \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\" in Tây Ninh, but the province is wrong. There is no new ward named \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\" in the list of wards in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSo, after going through these resolutions and the list of new wards, it appears that the old ward \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý, Huyện Tháp Mười, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\" has not been directly addressed within the available information. It might have been omitted or it could be part of a resolution that hasn't been provided.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý, Huyện Tháp Mười, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 16630,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0036779000000000004,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý, Huyện Tháp Mười, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, the user wants me to find the updated administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tháp Mười\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". My initial thought is to break this down.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the structure. We have the ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), the district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tháp Mười\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), and the province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). Checking for province changes first is usually a good idea, so I glanced at the province resolutions. Ah, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is still valid, though it now also includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tiền Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" No direct impact on the ward mapping here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I'll dive into the resolutions. I'm looking for mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the context (province and district) is crucial. Resolution 1654 for An Giang mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mỹ Quý,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but it's a phường, not a xã, and in the wrong province. 1663 for Đồng Tháp is promising, but the relevant lines focus on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mỹ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mỹ Hòa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mỹ Quý.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The other resolutions are for different provinces (Hưng Yên, Phú Thọ, Tây Ninh, Thanh Hóa) – no luck there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, the provided resolutions don't directly give me the answer. This could mean a few things: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" might have stayed unchanged, the relevant resolution might not be in this list, or maybe there's some confusion due to a similar name.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI'll check the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list now. The list mentions several wards but nothing matches \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Đồng Tháp. There's a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Tây Ninh, which is a significant distractor and likely confuses the issue. Resolution 1682 confirmed this one (Mỹ Thạnh Bắc, Mỹ Quý Đông và Mỹ Quý Tây).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, based on this provided data, I haven't been able to locate the updated administrative unit of  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from this current data set. I need more information to confirm this answer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý, Huyện Tháp Mười, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8895,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0037803999999999997,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Administrative Unit Maze**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so the user wants to find the new administrative unit for the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý, Huyện Tháp Mười, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My initial thought is to break this down. First, I need to identify the components: the old ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), the old district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tháp Mười\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), and the old province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). Easy enough.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to check the resolutions. Let's start with the province changes. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Đồng Tháp remained Đồng Tháp after a merger, which means the province name shouldn't have changed. Good.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm diving into the other resolutions, meticulously scanning each one for any mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *within* Đồng Tháp. I see a few that might be promising: 1654, 1663, 1666, 1676, 1682, and 1686.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1663 looks the most promising initially, but a careful scan confirms that it's dealing with Mỹ An, Mỹ Hòa, Hưng Thạnh, and Phương Thịnh, none of which are relevant. I'm noting that the resolution also focuses on Tháp Mười, which seems like a good sign.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen I get to 1682, and bingo! There's a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but upon closer inspection, it's in Tây Ninh, not Đồng Tháp. Crucial point: this is a different \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Damn! That was a distraction.  It mentions Mỹ Thạnh Bắc, Mỹ Quý Đông, and Mỹ Quý Tây forming a new Mỹ Quý. But it's in the wrong province, so it's irrelevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe rest of the resolutions are a dead end. No mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the relevant province. That means it looks like my conclusion, based on the resolutions, is that the user's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* specifically addressed in any of these documents.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I checked the new wards list. There's a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but it's from Tây Ninh again, confirming my findings from the resolution check.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, in summary: I couldn't find a direct mapping of the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from Đồng Tháp to a new administrative unit within the given data. The resolutions don't specify any changes for this specific ward, at least not in the provided documents, and the new wards list also doesn't provide any answers. My final verdict is that I need more data or clarification, as I was unable to find the new equivalent ward from the available info.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Tiền Giang và tỉnh Đồng Tháp, lấy tên là tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"N/A\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"The specific ward 'Xã Mỹ Quý' from 'Tỉnh Đồng Tháp' is not mentioned in the provided resolutions for ward restructuring.

Then, I'll analyze the relevant resolutions (specifically Resolution 60-NQ/TW and others) and the list of new wards provided to determine any changes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nInitially, the address breaks down as follows: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tháp Mười\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (province).  Now, I'm checking the resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW concerns province mergers, and thankfully, it explicitly states that Đồng Tháp remains Đồng Tháp, so no province name change here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I thoroughly scan through the other resolutions, focusing on those that might involve \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I encountered `1663/NQ-UBTVQH15`, but it concerns the consolidation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ An, xã Mỹ An và xã Mỹ Hòa into xã Tháp Mười, and the consolidation of xã Hưng Thạnh and xã Phương Thịnh into xã Phương Thịnh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Unfortunately, none of those changes seem to affect my target \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI came across `1682/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which discusses the consolidation of other wards into the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But a critical detail emerged: this resolution relates to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  It references another \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in a completely different province! That's a classic case of identical names causing confusion, but it's important to be meticulous. The provided address is in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tây Ninh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" therefore, this resolution is *irrelevant*. The subsequent resolutions did not contain any mentions of my target \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I reviewed the new wards list, but none matched the original information. The sole match for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, based on my analysis of the provided resolutions and the list of new wards, it appears that the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Quý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tháp Mười, Tỉnh Đồng Tháp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has *not* undergone any changes as detailed in the available information.
