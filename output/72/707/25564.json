  "thought": "**Processing the Ward Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this ward mapping problem. I need to take the old ward, `Xã Phước Minh, Huyện Dương Minh Châu, Tỉnh Tây Ninh`, and figure out which new wards it's been absorbed into, based on the provided resolutions. I know the user wants a JSON array as the output, following a specific schema.\n\nFirst, I've broken down the old ward's components. I've got `Xã Phước Minh`, which is the ward name, `Huyện Dương Minh Châu` which is the district, and `Tỉnh Tây Ninh`, which is the province. The district is less relevant here since we're dealing with mergers at a higher level, so I'll focus on the ward and province for now.\n\nThe initial step is to determine if the province, `Tỉnh Tây Ninh`, has changed its name. Looking at the province resolutions, I quickly identify `60-NQ/TW`, specifically item 18, which states that `Tỉnh Tây Ninh` *merged with* `Tỉnh Long An` *and retained the name* `Tỉnh Tây Ninh`.  So the province name *did not* change. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the crucial part: I've got to scan the *other* resolutions for any mention of \"Phước Minh.\" I'll be going through the `lines` of each resolution object.\n\nI found `Resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tỉnh Đồng Nai)`, which also mentions \"Phước Minh\". However, that's in `Tỉnh Đồng Nai`, and my input is from `Tỉnh Tây Ninh`, so I can safely ignore that one. The same applies to `Resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tỉnh Khánh Hòa)`: another `Phước Minh`, but the wrong province, so I disregard it.\n\nThen, there's `Resolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15` *for* `Tỉnh Tây Ninh`. Jackpot! Here, in Line 62, it states that \"a part\" of `Xã Phước Minh` is absorbed into a new ward called `Xã Lộc Ninh`. Furthermore, on Line 64, it explains that \"the rest\" of `Xã Phước Minh` is merged into `Xã Dương Minh Châu`. That confirms that *both* `Xã Lộc Ninh` and `Xã Dương Minh Châu` are the new wards that contain the area of the old `Xã Phước Minh`.\n\nSo, it seems I now have the data to build the JSON response: `Xã Phước Minh` has been split, with parts going to both `Xã Lộc Ninh` and `Xã Dương Minh Châu`. Now I have to make sure the user wants me to include both parts, which I think they do. I can begin construction of the output now, I believe.\n",

My task is to figure out the new administrative unit for \\\"Xã Phước Minh, Huyện Dương Minh Châu, Tỉnh Tây Ninh.\\\"\\n\\nFirst, I need to analyze the input. It's a straightforward address: Xã Phước Minh (ward), Huyện Dương Minh Châu (district), Tỉnh Tây Ninh (province).\\n\\nNext, I'll start with the province.  I have to ensure the province name hasn't changed. Given that the provided new wards are from Tây Ninh, that's where I need to focus.  Checking the resolutions, I found one relevant one:  Hợp nhất tỉnh Tây Ninh và tỉnh Long An, lấy tên là tỉnh Tây Ninh - which confirms that the new province name is indeed \\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\". So, that's a good start.\\n\\nNow for the crucial part: \\\"Xã Phước Minh.\\\" I'll need to meticulously scan the available resolutions, particularly the ones that address Tây Ninh, the province in the input address.  My strategy will be to look for any resolution that mentions \\\"Phước Minh.\\\"\\n\\nI analyzed several resolutions: 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 and 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15. Resolution 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15 focused on Đồng Nai, and 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 focused on Khánh Hòa. They mention \\\"Phước Minh,\\\" but aren't relevant to the Tây Ninh address. They can be discounted.\\n\\nBingo! Resolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15 is the key. It pertains to Tây Ninh!  Line 62 is important, showing that **a part** of \\\"Phước Minh\\\" was merged into the new \\\"Xã Lộc Ninh.\\\" Then, line 64 shows that the **remaining part** went into \\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu.\\\" This indicates that \\\"Phước Minh\\\" has been split. Therefore, the old address is now either \\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\" or \\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu.\\\"\\n\\nFinally, I'll cross-reference those two candidate wards.  \\n*   \\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\" is mentioned in Resolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\n*   \\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu\\\" is also mentioned in Resolution 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\nI have two possible new administrative units.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1682/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tây Ninh\",\n        \"line\": \"62.

My goal is to map this old Vietnamese address, \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh, Huyện Dương Minh Châu, Tỉnh Tây Ninh,\\\\\\\" to the new administrative units, based on the provided resolutions and the list of new wards.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to identify the old components: \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\" is the old ward, \\\\\\\"Huyện Dương Minh Châu\\\\\\\" is the old district (though it's being eliminated, so it's just context), and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\" is the old province.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I look at the Provincial Resolutions.  I checked Resolution 60-NQ/TW to see if anything happened to Tây Ninh. Fortunately, it's not on the \\\\\\\"not affected\\\\\\\" list. It *is* on the \\\\\\\"merged\\\\\\\" list, but it's merged with Long An and *keeps* the name \\\\\\\"Tây Ninh.\\\\\\\" So, for our purposes here, the province remains the same.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to focus on the ward itself within Tây Ninh. Scanning the other relevant resolutions, I eliminate the ones that mention \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\" but are in Đồng Nai and Khánh Hòa.  Then, I hit the jackpot with `1682/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Tây Ninh). This resolution is critical.\\\\n\\\\n*   Line 62: It states that part of \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\" merges with other wards to form the new \\\\\\\"Xã Lộc Ninh.\\\\\\\"\\\\n*   Line 64: The remaining part of \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\" (after the split) merges with the other wards and becomes the new \\\\\\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\" is *split* between two new wards.  I've already identified the new wards based on the resolutions: \\\\\\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow, I need to see if these new wards match the provided list: \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" list. Bingo!  I see a match for both:  `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"25552\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\"}` and `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"25579\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\"}`.\\\\n\\\\nHere's the rub: because the original \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\" is *divided* between these two new wards, I cannot map the *entire* old ward to a single new one. I'd need more specific location information, like a sub-unit, within the old \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\" to pinpoint which part went where. Without that, the best I can say is that \\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\" is now split between \\\\\\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu.\\\\\\\"  The confidence here is high, because the resolutions are clear on the split.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"18.

The user wants me to map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh, Huyện Dương Minh Châu, Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to new administrative units.  First, I'd break down the address: I see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Dương Minh Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old district (which isn't relevant for the final output, as the prompt specifies, but gives me context), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, let's look at the resolutions.  The prompt mentions checking 60-NQ/TW for province-level changes.  Tây Ninh is *not* in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list.  I see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Tây Ninh và tỉnh Long An, lấy tên là tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list.  So, based on that, even though there's been a provincial merger with Long An, Tây Ninh remains Tây Ninh.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to check resolutions for changes *within* Tây Ninh, specifically targeting \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I've got three to scan: 1662/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Đồng Nai), 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Khánh Hòa), and 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tây Ninh).  The first two don't help, as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is mentioned, but in the wrong provinces.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tây Ninh) looks promising. Line 62 explicitly states that parts of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" were combined with other areas to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Then, line 64 says the remaining part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (after the part that went to Lộc Ninh) became part of a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I'll cross-reference those findings with the list of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" provided. There's a match: `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"25552\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}` aligns perfectly with the resolution. There's also `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"25579\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tây Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`, another clear match.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe challenge here is that *parts* of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" became \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and *parts* became \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The key takeaway is the original ward is now completely split. Without more granular location data *within* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Phước Minh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" it's impossible to map the *entire* old ward to a single new ward. The best I can say definitively is that parts of it are now in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lộc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and parts are in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dương Minh Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".
