The process involves a methodical deconstruction of the request, detailed analysis, and precise referencing of source documents.\n\nFirst, I dissect the user's instructions: identifying the specific old ward (Xã Quang Phong), the task (finding its new equivalent), the key reference documents (Province resolutions and other resolutions), the desired output format (JSON array following a specified schema), and the importance of indicating confidence levels and citing the resolutions used.\n\nThe analysis commences with examining the old ward's components: name (Xã Quang Phong), district (Huyện Quế Phong), and province (Tỉnh Nghệ An). The province resolution, specifically 60-NQ/TW, affirms Nghệ An's unchanged provincial status. This verification ensures alignment with the provided \"New wards\" data.\n\nNext, I meticulously scrutinize \"Other resolutions\" for mentions of \"Xã Quang Phong\" and \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\".  I quickly discard irrelevant resolutions from provinces like Đà Nẵng, Quảng Ninh, Quảng Trị, and Thái Nguyên. Resolution 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Nghệ An) becomes the focal point.  Line 56 explicitly details the merging of Xã Quang Phong, Cắm Muộn, and Châu Thôn into a new entity, Xã Mường Quàng.  The context perfectly aligns, warranting a high confidence rating.\n\nI meticulously review Line 114 within the same resolution, mentioning another Quang Phong merged into Phường Thái Hòa. However, my attention immediately hones in on the nature of the units being merged; a `xã` and a `phường` are different. The original input is a `xã`, not a `phường`. This is a crucial distinction. Furthermore, the district of the original input unit (Huyện Quế Phong) aligns perfectly with the communes (Cắm Muộn, Châu Thôn) mentioned in line 56. I definitively rule out this latter case.\n\nThus, the mapping of Xã Quang Phong to Xã Mường Quàng stands as the most accurate. The other resolutions are re-checked, confirming that this is the only relevant match.\n\nThe ultimate output is a JSON array containing a single object, indicating a high confidence level and precise citation from the resolution, solidifying the mapping of Xã Quang Phong to Xã Mường Quàng. The \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" province name, \"16774\" ward code, and \"Xã Mường Quàng\" ward name are precisely documented in the final JSON output.\n",

My initial step is to break down the input and clarify the context. The province, Nghệ An, remains as is per the current resolutions.  Now, I'm digging into specific resolutions looking for any information on \\\"Quang Phong\\\".\\n\\nI'm starting with the most relevant resolution, 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15, because it's specifically about Nghệ An.  Bingo! Line 56 directly addresses \\\"Xã Quang Phong.\\\" It states that it's been merged with \\\"Cắm Muộn\\\" and \\\"Châu Thôn\\\" to form a new ward named \\\"Xã Mường Quàng\\\". Perfect match, right?\\n\\nBut wait. There's another mention of \\\"Quang Phong\\\" in this resolution, in line 114. This one refers to the merger of \\\"phường Hòa Hiếu, Long Sơn, and Quang Phong\\\" to create \\\"phường Thái Hòa\\\".  That seems fishy because the original question mentions an old *xã* and this is discussing a *phường*.\\n\\nLet's double-check. The input lists the \\\"Huyện Quế Phong\\\". Line 56 mentions rural *xã* within the huyện context. Line 114 is likely a different entity.\\n\\nSo, concluding based on the context and the explicit mention in resolution 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15, \\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\" has been reconfigured and now exists as part of \\\"Xã Mường Quàng\\\".

My goal is to pinpoint the new administrative unit corresponding to the old \\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\" in Quế Phong District, Nghệ An Province.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the province, Nghệ An, is safe. Resolution 60-NQ/TW explicitly states that the province name remains unchanged. That part is straightforward.\\\\n\\\\nNow, on to the more interesting part: the actual ward. Scanning through relevant resolutions, 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 (the Nghệ An resolution) immediately catches my eye.  Line 56 is the key. It details the merger of \\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\" with \\\\\\\"Cắm Muộn\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Châu Thôn,\\\\\\\" forming a new unit: \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Quàng.\\\\\\\"  Bingo! The surrounding context, all within Quế Phong District, confirms this is the correct \\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\". I found a record for \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Quàng\\\\\\\" in the data, so it is a valid name.\\\\n\\\\nI did notice another mention of \\\\\\\"Quang Phong\\\\\\\" in this same resolution (Line 114), but it's referring to \\\\\\\"phường Quang Phong.\\\\\\\" This appears to be a different entity since it involves Thị xã Thái Hòa, and not Huyện Quế Phong. I'm reasonably confident that these are distinct units, likely a coincidence in naming.\\\\n\\\\nSo, concluding this analysis: \\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\" is now part of the new ward, \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Quàng\\\\\\\". The old unit is merged with other units to form the new unit and the result is available in the data as I expected. I am confident in this finding, given the clarity of Resolution 1678.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Nghệ An\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"56.

Now, the real work begins. I need to dive into the resolutions and see what changes affect \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI quickly rule out Resolution 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15 because it concerns Đà Nẵng, which isn't relevant. Then, I hit Resolution 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15, the Nghệ An specific one, and I'm laser-focused.  Right away, on line 56, bingo! It says, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Cắm Muộn, Châu Thôn và **Quang Phong** thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Mường Quàng**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Translation: Quang Phong is merged with Cắm Muộn and Châu Thôn to form Xã Mường Quàng.  That looks very promising.  I'll verify that in the list of new wards: `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"16774\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Quàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}` - bingo!  It's a perfect match.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLines 57 and 58 don't mention Quang Phong. But then, on line 114, another \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" pops up, but as a *phường*. That means \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Hòa Hiếu, Long Sơn và **Quang Phong**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are being merged to form a new one named **phường Thái Hòa**. I pause. It's confusing.  Could there be a Phường Quang Phong *and* a Xã Quang Phong in Nghệ An? I remind myself to look at the other context and, given the original input, the Huyen Quế Phong, Line 56 is the one to use.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"56.

The user has given me an old address and wants the new one after some recent administrative changes. I know the province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". My first task is to see if that's been affected. Looking at `60-NQ/TW`, the answer is no; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains the same.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, focusing on the specific locality, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong, Huyện Quế Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I need to search through the resolutions for any mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". `1678/NQ-UBTVQH15` seems like the key. Scanning it, I see that resolution line 56 states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is merged with two other wards to become \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**xã Mường Quàng**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So, one potential match is clear. This resolution doesn't specify which district this particular \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is in but it does match the required format for an address.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, there's resolution line 114 which states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is merged with two other wards to become \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**phường Thái Hòa**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This resolution mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" rather than \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I am not sure if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" refer to the same place, and the prompt does state that most wards have changed, but this is a point of ambiguity. However, the context of the user being an expert suggests keeping all possibilities open.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI've also checked the list of `New wards`. It confirms the existence of  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Quàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thái Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe match for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Quàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is explicit. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thái Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has a possibility too, given the ambiguous change.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, my preliminary conclusion is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong, Huyện Quế Phong, Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has the potential to become one of two new addresses: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Quàng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thái Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", both in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"56.

First things first: I know \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Nghe An Province) is not affected by any province-level mergers based on `60-NQ/TW`.

I'm starting with `1678/NQ-UBTVQH15` because it deals with administrative re-organization within Nghe An.  Line 56 is the key. It states, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Cắm Muộn, Châu Thôn và Quang Phong thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Mường Quàng**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Bingo!  This strongly suggests that at least *part* of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Quàng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLine 57 creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Quế Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't listed as part of this new unit.  Line 58 is irrelevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, line 114 throws a curveball: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các phường Hòa Hiếu, Long Sơn và Quang Phong thành phường mới có tên gọi là **phường Thái Hòa**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This clearly references \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quang Phong,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but as a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward), not a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (commune).

I'd flag that as an ambiguity to keep in mind, because contextually, the phrase from the prompt is true and I should try to derive the two possibilities as the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Quang Phong\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"56.
