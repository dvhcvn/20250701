  "thought": "**Processing the Ward Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this. The user's given me an old ward (\"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\") and wants the new ward it's been merged into, based on the provided resolutions. My expert instinct kicks in, and I start breaking this down step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I dissect the request: I've got the old ward, the goal (to find its new equivalent), the source (resolutions), the expected output (JSON following the schema), and the understanding that I need to indicate low confidence if things are unclear. I make a mental note to cite the relevant resolutions and lines.\n\nNext, I zero in on the old ward itself. \"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\" - easy enough.\n\nThen, I consult the province resolutions, specifically looking for any mergers involving Tỉnh Nghệ An. The good news is, resolution \"60-NQ/TW\" confirms that Nghệ An didn't merge with anything at the province level. So, the new province remains Tỉnh Nghệ An. That's a solid start.\n\nNow, I turn to the \"Other resolutions\" to see what's happening at the district and ward levels. Resolution \"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Nghệ An\" is the most promising. I carefully go through its lines, looking for any mention of Xã Hưng Yên. I find mentions of \"Hưng Yên Bắc\" and \"Hưng Yên Nam\" in line 27, which seems promising. The line states that they are merged into the ward named \"Yên Trung.\" However, it doesn't *directly* mention \"Xã Hưng Yên\".\n\nHere's where my expertise comes into play. I re-evaluate: the user's input is \"Xã Hưng Yên\". Line 27 mentions \"Hưng Yên Bắc\" and \"Hưng Yên Nam\" as being merged into the new ward, \"Yên Trung.\" It's plausible that Xã Hưng Yên was split into \"Hưng Yên Bắc\" and \"Hưng Yên Nam\" in an earlier resolution (not provided), or the old ward has a variation in name. The close proximity of the old and the named new ward, the province, and the context are all consistent, so I suspect a connection exists, but it needs confirmation.\n\nSo, I check if \"Xã Yên Trung\" is in my list. It is!\n\nConsidering the lack of direct correlation, I'll need to indicate \"low\" confidence. The mapping isn't directly stated; it's an educated guess based on related entities and contexts.\n\nI then construct the JSON output. I'm putting \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" as the province, \"Xã Yên Trung\" as the ward name and \"18007\" for the ward code, given the resolution details. I'm carefully documenting this with \"low\" confidence and the cited resolution along with the specific line.\n\nFinally, I do a quick review, to make sure I followed the schema and the JSON is correct. This should be good to go.\n",
