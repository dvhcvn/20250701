  "thought": "**Processing the Ward Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this. The user's given me an old ward (\"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\") and wants the new ward it's been merged into, based on the provided resolutions. My expert instinct kicks in, and I start breaking this down step-by-step.\n\nFirst, I dissect the request: I've got the old ward, the goal (to find its new equivalent), the source (resolutions), the expected output (JSON following the schema), and the understanding that I need to indicate low confidence if things are unclear. I make a mental note to cite the relevant resolutions and lines.\n\nNext, I zero in on the old ward itself. \"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\" - easy enough.\n\nThen, I consult the province resolutions, specifically looking for any mergers involving Tỉnh Nghệ An. The good news is, resolution \"60-NQ/TW\" confirms that Nghệ An didn't merge with anything at the province level. So, the new province remains Tỉnh Nghệ An. That's a solid start.\n\nNow, I turn to the \"Other resolutions\" to see what's happening at the district and ward levels. Resolution \"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Nghệ An\" is the most promising. I carefully go through its lines, looking for any mention of Xã Hưng Yên. I find mentions of \"Hưng Yên Bắc\" and \"Hưng Yên Nam\" in line 27, which seems promising. The line states that they are merged into the ward named \"Yên Trung.\" However, it doesn't *directly* mention \"Xã Hưng Yên\".\n\nHere's where my expertise comes into play. I re-evaluate: the user's input is \"Xã Hưng Yên\". Line 27 mentions \"Hưng Yên Bắc\" and \"Hưng Yên Nam\" as being merged into the new ward, \"Yên Trung.\" It's plausible that Xã Hưng Yên was split into \"Hưng Yên Bắc\" and \"Hưng Yên Nam\" in an earlier resolution (not provided), or the old ward has a variation in name. The close proximity of the old and the named new ward, the province, and the context are all consistent, so I suspect a connection exists, but it needs confirmation.\n\nSo, I check if \"Xã Yên Trung\" is in my list. It is!\n\nConsidering the lack of direct correlation, I'll need to indicate \"low\" confidence. The mapping isn't directly stated; it's an educated guess based on related entities and contexts.\n\nI then construct the JSON output. I'm putting \"Tỉnh Nghệ An\" as the province, \"Xã Yên Trung\" as the ward name and \"18007\" for the ward code, given the resolution details. I'm carefully documenting this with \"low\" confidence and the cited resolution along with the specific line.\n\nFinally, I do a quick review, to make sure I followed the schema and the JSON is correct. This should be good to go.\n",

I need to make sure I understand the context, specifically whether any districts were eliminated or provinces merged. First, I have to analyze the input: \\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\" (ward), \\\"Huyện Hưng Nguyên\\\" (district), and \\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\" (province).\\n\\nAccording to the user, there might have been district eliminations and province mergers. I immediately check Resolution 60-NQ/TW to see if \\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\" was affected. Thankfully, item 9 lists \\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\" as not being merged. So, \\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\" remains unchanged.\\n\\nNow, I shift my focus to finding the relevant resolutions concerning ward/commune level changes in Nghệ An. I quickly skim through the resolutions provided. Resolution `1654/NQ-UBTVQH15` (An Giang), `1666/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Hưng Yên), `1674/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Ninh Bình), `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Phú Thọ) and `1686/NQ-UBTVQH15` (Thanh Hóa) are irrelevant. The key is to find resolution `1678/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which pertains to Nghệ An.\\n\\nWithin resolution `1678/NQ-UBTVQH15`, I carefully examine each line. Specifically, line 27 catches my eye. It states that \\\"Hưng Yên Bắc\\\", \\\"Hưng Yên Nam\\\" and \\\"Hưng Trung\\\" were merged into a new ward called \\\"xã Yên Trung.\\\" The original input is \\\"Xã Hưng Yên.\\\" While it's not a direct match, the close proximity suggests that \\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\" has to be closely related to either \\\"Hưng Yên Bắc\\\" or \\\"Hưng Yên Nam\\\". The context of ward-level reorganizations within \\\"Huyện Hưng Nguyên\\\" further reinforces the likelihood that \\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\" is indeed involved.\\n\\nBased on this, I conclude that \\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\" from \\\"Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\" has likely been re-organized and is now part of the new ward: **xã Yên Trung**.

The user wants the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\". First, I need to understand what's changed within Nghệ An province. They mentioned district eliminations and potential province mergers, so I started with Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Good news – Nghệ An (Tỉnh Nghệ An) wasn't merged. That simplifies things, the province name stays the same.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to focus on ward-level changes within Nghệ An. I've been given a list of relevant resolutions. I quickly dismissed those that didn't apply (An Giang, Hưng Yên, Ninh Bình, Phú Thọ, and Thanh Hóa). Resolution 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Nghệ An is the key.\\\\n\\\\nI examined this resolution line by line. Line 26 described a merger into \\\\\\\"xã Hưng Nguyên\\\\\\\", which is not related to \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\". Line 27 caught my eye: it mentions the consolidation of \\\\\\\"Hưng Yên Bắc\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Hưng Yên Nam\\\\\\\" into a new ward called \\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\". My initial thought is the user's input of \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\" has to be related to \\\\\\\"Hưng Yên Bắc\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Hưng Yên Nam\\\\\\\". Given the surrounding context within the resolution, it seems highly plausible that \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\" was involved in this merger. Line 28 describes a merger into \\\\\\\"xã Hưng Nguyên Nam\\\\\\\", which is not related to \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nIn essence, I'm confident that the old \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\" *likely* became part of the new \\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\". The fact that the resolution focuses on Hưng Nguyên district further strengthens this conclusion. There is a slight uncertainty since the precise connection to \\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly stated. However, given the evidence and context, \\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\" is the most probable new administrative unit. I'd need further confirmation to be absolutely certain, but this is the best analysis I can provide based on the information available.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Nghệ An\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"27.

My task is to determine the current administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on the provided resolutions. I'll approach this as follows:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to confirm the province, which is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Checking the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" resolution, Nghệ An is not listed for any province-level mergers. That seems straightforward enough.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I'll meticulously go through each of the relevant resolutions, focusing specifically on mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hưng Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It is crucial that I analyze each line to locate any possible name change or relocation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first four resolutions are quickly dismissed as they are not about Nghệ An. Now, resolution \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Nghệ An)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" warrants my full attention. I'll read each line carefully.  Lines 26, 27, and 28 are the key ones to review, as they describe administrative changes within the area.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 26 talks about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Hưng Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and nearby communes, which doesn't directly correspond to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Line 27 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Yên Bắc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Yên Nam,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which are merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  This is interesting, but the input is explicitly \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so it's not a direct match. The possibility of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being a typo for one of the merged entities exists, but I have no way to confirm that.  Finally, line 28 describes the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Hưng Nguyên Nam,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  which isn't what I'm looking for either.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy analysis of the resolutions indicates that none specifically address or modify \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I will then carefully re-read the prompt to ensure I am answering correctly: specifically, I need to go through each resolution to identify if the ward (Xã Hưng Yên) is mentioned. Then, find the new possible administrative unit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the resolutions, and none of the new wards in the dataset share its name, I cannot definitively determine the new administrative unit based on the information provided. The information is insufficient or I am not sure what is correct, confidence is low.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**New Wards:** I also searched the provided list for any possible matches, but found no related named wards in the area.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 7431,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0032218999999999998,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Administrative Unit Restructuring for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I've been tasked with pinpointing the new administrative unit corresponding to the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên, Huyện Hưng Nguyên, Tỉnh Nghệ An.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  My starting point is always to dissect the old address:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Province) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Ward).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe first step is to quickly check the provincial-level restructuring.  Resolution 60-NQ/TW is the go-to document here.  It explicitly states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't being merged or renamed.  Therefore, the `province_name` in the output will remain \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  That was straightforward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the trickier part:  figuring out what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I need to meticulously sift through the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data, focusing on those relevant to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I'm looking for any clues about ward-level adjustments.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI systematically went through each resolution:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   I dismissed the resolution for An Giang immediately.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   Similarly, resolutions related to Hưng Yên, Ninh Bình, and Phú Thọ are irrelevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   The key is Resolution 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Nghệ An itself.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis resolution is quite detailed.  It discusses creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Hưng Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from a combination of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Hưng Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and other wards. However, it doesn't mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" directly.

My initial step is to break down the address and identify the key components: the province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") and the ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\").\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI immediately check the province resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW). Fortunately, resolution 60-NQ/TW explicitly states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will not be merged or renamed. This means the province name in my output will remain \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Simple enough.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, the more complex part: determining the fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I'll systematically review the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"new wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data, focusing on resolutions relevant to Nghệ An.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI scan the resolutions, and I quickly rule out resolutions related to An Giang, Hưng Yên, Ninh Bình, and Phú Thọ as these are clearly not relevant to my query. Then, I hit the jackpot with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1678/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is promising.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWithin this resolution, I find two key entries. The first one talks about creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Hưng Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Hưng Nguyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and other wards. This is relevant, but it doesn't seem directly related to my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, the second entry in this resolution sparks my interest: it mentions the merging of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Yên Bắc\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Yên Nam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This suggests that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" might have been further subdivided. It's plausible that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a name is no longer valid, or that it became part of this new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, based on my analysis of the relevant resolutions, I'm leaning towards the new administrative unit being \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I will need further clarification to be 100% sure if the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was renamed in its entirety, or if parts of it contributed to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I'll keep this in mind as I build my solution, but for now, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Yên Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" seems like the most likely outcome.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"9.
