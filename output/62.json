  "thought": "**Analysis and Synthesis: Finding the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so the user wants me to find the new administrative unit corresponding to the old \"Tỉnh Kon Tum\" based on these resolutions. My first thought is to break this down. They've provided two resolutions and want a JSON array as the output. The key here is to identify where \"Tỉnh Kon Tum\" is mentioned in these documents, and then map it to the requested JSON format, ensuring that \"low\" confidence is provided if no specific match is found.\n\nI'll start by systematically going through each resolution. Resolution 1,  `60-NQ/TW`, focuses on provinces *not* merged. Scanning it, I see a list, but \"Tỉnh Kon Tum\" isn't included.  This tells me it *was* merged, so I will now need to review resolution 2.\n\nResolution 2, also `60-NQ/TW`, outlines the mergers. I'll read through this and quickly locate line 11. \"Hợp nhất tỉnh Kon Tum và tỉnh Quảng Ngãi, lấy tên là tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\" This looks promising! It directly states that Kon Tum was merged with Quảng Ngãi, resulting in the new unit, Quảng Ngãi.\n\nNext, I need to get the `provinceId` for Quảng Ngãi. I'll check the provided province list, where I find {\"provinceId\":\"51\",\"provinceName\":\"Quảng Ngãi\"}. Perfect.\n\nNow it's time to build the JSON object. The `citation` is straightforward: the header is the resolution and the line is the specific sentence from Resolution 2. The `confidence` is \"high\" as the resolution explicitly describes this merger. So, the output will contain `province_code` \"51\" and `province_name` \"Quảng Ngãi\".  I should make sure that the final result follows the JSON schema specified by the user.\n\nFinally, one last scan to confirm the single JSON array, and the information is complete and concise. Now, I'm ready to output the JSON response.\n",
