I need to figure out the current administrative unit for the old ward \"Xã Thắng Lợi, Huyện Văn Giang, Tỉnh Hưng Yên\". First, the province is still valid, \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên,\" according to Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Great. Now, the main task: I'm digging into various resolutions, specifically 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, because it deals with Hưng Yên.\n\nI've carefully read through the resolutions, and it's looking tricky. Line 33 of Resolution 1666 mentions a \"xã Thắng Lợi\" being merged into a new \"Xã Mễ Sở\". However, the resolution specifically mentions that this \"Thắng Lợi\" is in Huyện Khoái Châu, *not* Huyện Văn Giang which is what my input has. That's a huge red flag – district mismatch!  I've re-read it several times because it's the only direct reference to a \"Thắng Lợi\" in Hưng Yên.\n\nOn the other hand, line 32 in the same resolution is specifically dealing with Huyện Văn Giang, but it doesn't mention \"Xã Thắng Lợi\". I checked the new ward data, and \"Xã Văn Giang\" is mentioned, but \"Xã Thắng Lợi\" is not one of the old wards listed in the merged units. \"Xã Mễ Sở\" is also mentioned, but it contains a \"Thắng Lợi\" that is from a different district.\n\nThis makes the task hard. I'm hesitant, but \"Xã Mễ Sở\" seems to be the closest match because of the name even though the districts don't match. It's the only one I can find that includes the ward name. I will output that, but the confidence level is low because the district is different (Khoái Châu vs Văn Giang). There is a *slim* chance that the resolution is ambiguous, or there's a missing link.\n\nSo, in conclusion, my top, but low-confidence, candidate is \"Xã Mễ Sở\". I'll flag it clearly as such because of the district mismatch, but it's the best option given the information. I had no other matches.\n",

Now, the hunt for \\\"Xã Thắng Lợi\\\" begins.\\n\\nI've been meticulously sifting through various resolutions.  Several resolutions (1656, 1657, 1664, 1677, 1679, 1683, and 1686) mention \\\"Thắng Lợi,\\\" but they pertain to different provinces: Hà Nội, Cao Bằng, Gia Lai, Quảng Ngãi, Quảng Ninh, Thái Nguyên, and Thanh Hóa.  No dice there.\\n\\nThat leaves me with Resolution 1666, specifically focused on Hưng Yên.  Here's where it gets interesting.  Line 33 of this resolution states: \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Bình Minh (huyện Khoái Châu), Thắng Lợi và Mễ Sở thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Mễ Sở**.\\\"  It clearly refers to \\\"Thắng Lợi,\\\" which seems like a strong lead. However, the catch is the district. It mentions \\\"huyện Khoái Châu\\\" alongside \\\"Thắng Lợi\\\". I'm specifically looking for a ward in \\\"Huyện Văn Giang\\\". The phrasing suggests \\\"Thắng Lợi\\\" is included with \\\"Huyện Khoái Châu.\\\" This immediately throws a wrench into the process. Could there have been two wards named \\\"Thắng Lợi\\\" in Hưng Yên at some point? The formatting isn't crystal clear on that point. This ambiguousness demands a closer examination of the original documents and perhaps an alternative data source to confirm that \\\"Xã Thắng Lợi, Huyện Văn Giang, Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\" is indeed now part of \\\"Xã Mễ Sở,\\\" or whether it's remained unaltered.

Then, I'm digging into these resolutions to see what's changed.\\\\n\\\\nMy initial thought is to cross-reference \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\" within these documents. I see a bunch of \\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\" mentions, but they're all in the wrong provinces - Hà Nội, Cao Bằng, Gia Lai, Quảng Ngãi, Quảng Ninh, and Thái Nguyên.  No luck there.\\\\n\\\\nThen I get to resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns Hưng Yên directly. I see two relevant mentions. One merges Tân Tiến, Liên Nghĩa, and Văn Giang into \\\\\\\"Xã Văn Giang,\\\\\\\" which is in my area of concern but doesn't include \\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi.\\\\\\\"  However, the second line, mentioning \\\\\\\"Bình Minh (huyện Khoái Châu), **Thắng Lợi**, and Mễ Sở thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Mễ Sở**\\\\\\\" does contain \\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow, this is where it gets interesting. While the location of \\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\" is not specifically stated, there's a district associated with Bình Minh in the same sentence: \\\\\\\"huyện Khoái Châu.\\\\\\\" This implies that \\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\" referred to here is from Huyện Khoái Châu. However, the input address is for Huyện Văn Giang. This needs further clarification. It's possible \\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\" from Văn Giang was merged into a different district, but the resolution doesn't definitively clarify. I'll need to research that specific administrative change further, as this isn't a direct match.  I'll need to determine the specific administrative decisions.  It's likely that a resolution doesn't explicitly mention the relevant \\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"12049\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi, Huyện Văn Giang, Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 8877,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0036716,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Navigating the Administrative Unit Maze**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I've been given an old address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi, Huyện Văn Giang, Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and need to find its current administrative equivalent. My first instinct is to break it down. I know I'm looking for a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (xã), a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"district\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (huyện), and if necessary, a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (tỉnh). Right now, the province is easy: Hưng Yên.  I need to check the resolutions to be sure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirstly, I'll identify the key parts of the old address:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is my old ward, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" give me the context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy initial scan of Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW) shows that Hưng Yên *remained* Hưng Yên after a proposed merger with Thái Bình. So no changes there. That's a relief.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the interesting part: I've got to dig into the other resolutions, specifically focusing on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I quickly zero in on `1666/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  This is where things get tricky.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI see a line: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"33. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Bình Minh (huyện Khoái Châu), Thắng Lợi và Mễ Sở thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Mễ Sở**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This line states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mễ Sở\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" alongside \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bình Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (from Khoái Châu). The crucial point here is the district. It clearly mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"(huyện Khoái Châu)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" after Bình Minh, which could mean that both Thắng Lợi and Mễ Sở are from Khoái Châu. However, the original address explicitly stated \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  If this \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the one from Văn Giang, then the resolutions show it's now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is a bit ambiguous, though. The language used in the resolution could imply a grouping where Bình Minh is explicitly *from* Khoái Châu, while Thắng Lợi and Mễ Sở's districts are left ambiguous. It's a key detail to confirm.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI need to confirm if the Thắng Lợi in the resolution refers to the Thắng Lợi from Văn Giang district. If so, then \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, this grouping might also imply that the current district of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is currently \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Khoái Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Further investigation is needed to clarify this ambiguity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"6.

The user wants to know the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi, Huyện Văn Giang, Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  First, I've got to break it down. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the province, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the district. The province is straightforward based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" even after a proposed merger with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" that didn't happen.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm focusing on finding the new name for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I've checked the other resolutions, specifically 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, and this is where it gets interesting.  There's a line, specifically number 33, that mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being merged into a new ward called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  But here's the kicker: the wording of this resolution (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"các xã Bình Minh (huyện Khoái Châu), Thắng Lợi và Mễ Sở\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") is ambiguous.  It could mean all three wards, including \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", are from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Khoái Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Or it could mean only \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bình Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is explicitly from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Khoái Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the other two are from the same district. The user's input specifies \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which complicates matters.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI need to confirm if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in this resolution is *the* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Lợi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The wording is very important here. If it is, then the new administrative unit is indeed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  If not, I've got to keep digging through the available resolutions and, potentially, other data sources to determine the correct mapping for this old address. I'll need to double-check the district of these other mentioned wards (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bình Minh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mễ Sở\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") and compare their geographical locations to confirm the correct resolution and resulting mapping.
