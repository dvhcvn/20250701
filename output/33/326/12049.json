  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Address Change**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user wants the new administrative unit for \"Xã Mễ Sở, Huyện Văn Giang, Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\"  First, I'm parsing the input: the ward is \"Xã Mễ Sở,\" the district is \"Huyện Văn Giang,\" and the province is \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\"\n\nMy initial thought is to check if any province-level changes happened.  I know about Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which discussed a merger, but it doesn't invalidate the province name.  \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\" is still the appropriate province.\n\nNow, the crucial step is to look for ward or district-level changes. I have a list of resolutions. My focus needs to be those related to Hưng Yên province.  I'm scanning for any mentions of \"Mễ Sở,\" \"Văn Giang,\" or \"Hưng Yên.\"\n\n**Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15** catches my eye because it specifically deals with \"Hưng Yên.\" I need to carefully read through it. I find that line 33 is the key: it directly addresses the merging of certain communes (including Mễ Sở) into a new \"xã Mễ Sở.\"  While there's mention of \"Huyện Khoái Châu\" with Bình Minh, I'm confident that the core of the old Mễ Sở is now part of this newly created \"xã Mễ Sở.\"\n\nI'm confident because the Resolution explicitly states the merger of \"Mễ Sở\" into the new \"xã Mễ Sở.\" Now, it's just a matter of confirming the new ward data.\n\nI'll check the list of new wards for a match.  Bingo! There's a perfect fit:  \"Xã Mễ Sở\" with code \"12049\" in \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\" This seems like a slam dunk.\n\nThe evidence is clear. The key piece is in Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 33. The final answer is \"Xã Mễ Sở,\" code \"12049,\" in \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\" I'm very confident about this conclusion.\n",

The user's asking me to find the equivalent of the old address \\\"Xã Mễ Sở, Huyện Văn Giang, Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\" in the new administrative structure.  I need to reconcile this against the provided resolutions and the list of new wards.\\n\\nFirst, I established that Hưng Yên itself is still the province, albeit a potentially enlarged one after a merger with Thái Bình according to resolution 60-NQ/TW.\\n\\nThen, I focused on the \\\"Xã Mễ Sở, Huyện Văn Giang\\\" part. The prompt states that districts are being eliminated, so \\\"Huyện Văn Giang\\\" is out. I need to figure out which *new* ward corresponds to the old \\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\".\\n\\nI dug into resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one about restructuring wards in Hưng Yên.  I was hoping to find a straightforward renaming or merger of \\\"Xã Mễ Sở, Huyện Văn Giang.\\\" Instead, I found line 33, which talks about a *new* \\\"xã Mễ Sở\\\" being formed by merging Bình Minh (from Khoái Châu), Thắng Lợi, and Mễ Sở. Crucially, the old \\\"Xã Mễ Sở, Huyện Văn Giang\\\" wasn't mentioned *there*.  That meant this Mễ Sở was from a different district.\\n\\nThis had me worried. Is the user's \\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\" simply gone? That's what I needed to find out next.\\n\\nFortunately, I looked at the \\\"New wards\\\" data.  I found an entry:  {\\\"ward_code\\\":\\\"12049\\\",\\\"ward_name\\\":\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\",\\\"province_name\\\":\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\"}.  Hah!  So there *is* a \\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\" still around, it's just a different entity.\\n\\nThe tricky part is that the old \\\"Xã Mễ Sở, Huyện Văn Giang\\\" *wasn't* explicitly renamed or merged in these resolutions. However, the presence of the new ward means that *something* must have happened. It's likely that the older ward was absorbed into the newer one. Without any further information, I'd say the new equivalent address is likely \\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\" with code \\\"12049\\\" in \\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\"\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1666/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Hưng Yên\",\n        \"line\": \"33.

The goal is to map this *old* address to the *new* administrative structure, considering the recent resolutions and the provided list of new wards.  Let's break it down:\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the province.  \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\" is in the old address.  My initial check against the province merging resolutions (\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\") shows that Hưng Yên *was* scheduled for merging with Thái Bình, to form a combined province *still* called \\\\\\\"Hưng Yên\\\\\\\". So, the province remains \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\". That simplifies things.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to pinpoint the new ward and any district equivalents, keeping in mind that the prompt explicitly mentioned \\\\\\\"eliminating all districts\\\\\\\". The old address is \\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở, Huyện Văn Giang\\\\\\\".  Since districts are gone, \\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Giang\\\\\\\" is irrelevant in the new system. The key will be finding \\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\" within the resolutions and the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" data.\\\\n\\\\nI scanned the \\\\\\\"Other resolutions,\\\\\\\" specifically focusing on those dealing with administrative changes in Hưng Yên.  Resolution \\\\\\\"1666/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\\\\\" is a primary target.  Line 32 discusses a merger *near* \\\\\\\"Văn Giang,\\\\\\\" but not \\\\\\\"Mễ Sở.\\\\\\\" However, on Line 33, my attention *is* drawn to the critical text: It describes a merger of Bình Minh (Huyện Khoái Châu), Thắng Lợi, and *also* Mễ Sở, to *create* a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\". This looks promising!\\\\n\\\\nBut then, the twist! After a closer look, the \\\\\\\"Mễ Sở\\\\\\\" in that resolution *isn't* the \\\\\\\"Mễ Sở\\\\\\\" I'm seeking. That \\\\\\\"Mễ Sở\\\\\\\" on Line 33 is associated with \\\\\\\"Huyện Khoái Châu\\\\\\\" -- a distinct area. My starting point is \\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở, Huyện Văn Giang\\\\\\\". This tells me the source \\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\" in the address *doesn't* appear to have been directly merged or renamed within the provided resolution set.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I had to look at the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" list for a direct match. And there it is!  I found: `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"12049\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\"}`. Bingo!\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, I'm facing a subtle but crucial distinction.  The resolution describes a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\" from different wards. *My* address's \\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\" is *not* that new ward, based on the provided resolutions. But, the \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" data *does* include a \\\\\\\"Xã Mễ Sở\\\\\\\" with code \\\\\\\"12049\\\\\\\", and in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên,\\\\\\\" just as I expected. I conclude that this entry represents the new ward corresponding to the given *old* address.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1666/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"33.
