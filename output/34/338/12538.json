  "thought": "**Analyzing the Mapping of a Former Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thought process: The user wants me to find the new equivalent of the old ward, `Xã An Quí, Huyện Quỳnh Phụ, Tỉnh Thái Bình`. I've got to use these resolutions to figure it out. First, I noticed that *Thái Bình* has merged into *Hưng Yên*. That's the easy part. The challenge is pinpointing what happened to `Xã An Quí`.\n\nI started by looking for any mention of `Xã An Quí` or `Huyện Quỳnh Phụ` within these resolutions. I quickly discounted the ones for different provinces like *Bắc Ninh*, *Nghệ An*, and *Vĩnh Long*. *Hưng Yên* was the relevant one, since that's where *Thái Bình* now resides.\n\nIn the *Hưng Yên* resolution (1666/NQ-UBTVQH15), I carefully read each line. The resolution mentions *Quỳnh Phụ* several times, which seemed promising! But, unfortunately, none of these lines explicitly included `Xã An Quí`. They spoke of *Quỳnh Côi*, *Quỳnh Hải*, *Quỳnh Hội*, *Quỳnh Hồng*, *Quỳnh Mỹ*, *Quỳnh Hưng*, *An Ninh*, *An Vũ*, *An Mỹ*, *An Thanh*, *Đồng Tiến*, *An Dục*, and *An Tràng*. None of those communes were mentioned in the provided input.\n\nI even encountered a potential false lead, a mention of \"An Qui\" in a *Vĩnh Long* resolution. But then I realized this was a different, unrelated `An Qui`.\n\nI've checked the list of new wards, and none of them seem like a match.\n\n**The issue is that the provided resolutions don't tell me what happened to `Xã An Quí`.**  Did it stay the same? Did it merge into a group of different communes? I don't have enough information to say. I've re-read everything a few times to make sure I'm not missing anything. I've ruled out the incorrect communes. Based on this, there is no mapping that can be definitively made using the available data.\n",

Let's break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the request. I've got to go through each resolution, look for mentions of the old ward, and identify the new ward that now contains it, according to the resolutions. If I'm unsure, I should mark it as low confidence, and I need to output a JSON array following the provided schema.\\n\\nAlright, the old ward is \\\"Xã An Quí\\\" in \\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\" of \\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình.\\\"\\n\\nNow, let's dive into these resolutions.\\n\\nThe **Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW)** are the first step.  I need to figure out what happened to \\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình.\\\" Ah, it merged with \\\"Hưng Yên\\\" to become \\\"Hưng Yên.\\\" That's crucial. \\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\" no longer exists; it's now part of \\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\" This means I'm looking for *Hưng Yên* resolutions going forward.\\n\\nNext, I look at the other resolutions, which are about merging communes/wards.\\n\\n**1658/NQ-UBTVQH15** (Bắc Ninh) is irrelevant; it's for Bắc Ninh, not Hưng Yên. Skip.\\n\\n**1666/NQ-UBTVQH15** (Hưng Yên): This is the *key* one. Since Thái Bình is now Hưng Yên, this is the first one I need to focus on. I need to be *very* careful with the details here.\\n*   Line 62: This *could* be relevant, but while it creates a new *Xã Quỳnh Phụ*, it doesn't mention *An Quí*.\\n*   Line 69:  Mentions \\\"(huyện Quỳnh Phụ)\\\". Creating a new \\\"Xã Phụ Dực\\\", again, not including \\\"An Quí\\\".\\n*   Line 70:  Also mentions \\\"(huyện Quỳnh Phụ)\\\". It creates a new \\\"Xã Tân Tiến\\\", but no \\\"An Quí\\\".\\n\\nThe other resolutions, **1678/NQ-UBTVQH15** (Nghệ An) and **1687/NQ-UBTVQH15** (Vĩnh Long), I can skip.\\n\\nSo, here's the challenge: while the Hưng Yên resolution (1666) is the relevant context, it doesn't *explicitly* mention \\\"An Quí.\\\"  All the lines that deal with Quỳnh Phụ only affect wards besides An Quí. I have to interpret if this implicitly means that it retains its status, or the resolution is incomplete. This warrants a low-confidence flag because I don't see a *direct* mapping for \\\"Xã An Quí.\\\" I'll need to indicate that \\\"An Quí\\\" isn't *directly* mentioned.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã An Quí, Huyện Quỳnh Phụ, Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 20232,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0042886999999999995,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Analysis of Administrative Unit Transformation**\\\\n\\\\nAlright, let's break down this request. My primary goal is to determine the updated administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã An Quí, Huyện Quỳnh Phụ, Tỉnh Thái Bình.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I parsed the original address: \\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\" is the province.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I turned to the relevant resolutions to see how these administrative units have been reorganized. Per Resolution 60-NQ/TW, \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\" has been merged into \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\" This changes the province to \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\" for our target address.\\\\n\\\\nThe critical task now is to determine if \\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\" has undergone any changes within the newly formed \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\". I meticulously reviewed the provided resolutions: 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15, and 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15. Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Bắc Ninh) and 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Nghệ An) and 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Vĩnh Long) were quickly dismissed as irrelevant. The key resolution is 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Hưng Yên.\\\\n\\\\nWithin Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, I examined lines that deal with Quỳnh Phụ. Line 62 discusses the merging of several wards into \\\\\\\"xã Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\", however \\\\\\\"An Quí\\\\\\\" is not explicitly mentioned. Line 69 mentions several communes in \\\\\\\"huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\" being merged into \\\\\\\"xã Phụ Dực\\\\\\\" and 70 mentions \\\\\\\"huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\" being merged into \\\\\\\"xã Tân Tiến.\\\\\\\" None of these mention \\\\\\\"An Quí\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nInterestingly, Resolution 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15 has a line (78) that explicitly merges a location named \\\\\\\"An Qui\\\\\\\" into a new \\\\\\\"xã An Qui\\\\\\\". However, this resolution pertains to Vĩnh Long province, which conflicts with our target address being located in Hưng Yên (formerly Thái Bình). This \\\\\\\"An Qui\\\\\\\" match introduces a clear conflict.\\\\n\\\\nThe resolution related to Hưng Yên does not provide a definitive answer for \\\\\\\"Xã An Quí.\\\\\\\" While the district name is the same as the proposed new commune name (Quỳnh Phụ), the name does not explicitly appear in the resolution.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1687/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"78.

The user wants me to find the new equivalent of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Quí, Huyện Quỳnh Phụ, Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". My process will be methodical. First, let's establish the context. We're dealing with a place that was once in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". My knowledge tells me that this province has been reorganized and merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (based on resolution 60-NQ/TW). That's the first significant shift.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I need to consult the relevant resolutions and data on administrative changes, specifically those related to this new province. My focus is going to be on identifying any re-organizations affecting \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and, crucially, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI've reviewed the provided resolutions. I immediately disregarded those for Bắc Ninh, Nghệ An, and Vĩnh Long as they are irrelevant. Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one covering changes in Hưng Yên (where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" now resides), seemed promising. I've noted that it renames several *xã* (wards) including \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (a different entity than the old district). While this confirmed that the old district of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was, at least in the past, a district, it didn't directly address my target \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, I scanned the resolution closely, looking for clues. The resolution contains other mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and how it's being shifted around as part of new ward formations. But nothing in those mentions specifically referred to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, I encountered Resolution 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one covering Vĩnh Long. While initially off-target, line 78 of the resolution has a match, *a mention of a new ward being named* **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Qui\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"** *during this* Vĩnh Long reorganization. I understand that context is crucial, but this is a *very* interesting parallel. The previous searches have all failed to identify a new unit. I'll need to go back over the text, confirm that the Vĩnh Long context does not make this resolution not relevant and analyze this further.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"6.

My first thought is to break it down.  I've got a ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), a district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), and a province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). Now, I need to consult the resolutions and ward data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I checked the province resolutions.  Bingo!  Resolution 60-NQ/TW tells me that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So, I now know I'm looking for matches within that new province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I dove into the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specifically looking for mentions of either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the context of the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I quickly dismissed resolutions concerning Bắc Ninh, Nghệ An, and Vĩnh Long.  Then I hit resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key one for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI scanned the resolution, taking notes as I went.  Lines 62, 69, and 70 all mentioned \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in some capacity, confirming that this district did exist in the old structure. Line 62 mentioned \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quỳnh Phụ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but it's now a new *xã* not a district. Line 69 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"An Ninh (huyện Quỳnh Phụ)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but not my target ward. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem: I didn't find *my* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mentioned specifically in any merges related to Huyện Quỳnh Phụ.  I checked through all the resolutions but there are no mergers involving *my* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã An Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within Huyện Quỳnh Phụ in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLine 78 in resolution 4 *does* mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"An Qui\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as part of a merger.
