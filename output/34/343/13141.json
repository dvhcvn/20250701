My task is to figure out the new administrative unit for \"Xã Vũ Quí, Huyện Kiến Xương, Tỉnh Thái Bình.\" First things first, I need to analyze the current structure: \"Xã Vũ Quí\" is the ward, \"Huyện Kiến Xương\" is the district, and \"Tỉnh Thái Bình\" is the province. Simple enough.\n\nNow, I'm armed with resolution 60-NQ/TW. This tells me that \"Tỉnh Thái Bình\" is part of the merge to create \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\" Got it. So, any old wards from \"Tỉnh Thái Bình\" are now under \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\"\n\nThe critical piece is resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning administrative re-arrangements in Hưng Yên. I've got to scan this document for mentions of \"Huyện Kiến Xương.\" I'm looking for any clues that include \"Xã Vũ Quí.\"\n\nI carefully analyze each relevant line in the resolution, paying attention to mergers within the Kiến Xương district. Unfortunately, none of the merger lines (79, 80, 81, or 83) mention \"Xã Vũ Quí\". It's simply not there.\n\nThis presents a problem. My initial analysis confirmed that the province shifted to \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\" But, the specific resolution I have doesn't address the future of \"Xã Vũ Quí\". The resolution *only* accounts for specific ward mergers. And \"Xã Vũ Quí\" is not one of them.\n\nGiven the instructions, I need to provide a conclusive answer. I can't definitively match \"Xã Vũ Quí\" with any new administrative unit based on the provided data.  The instructions guide me to provide any possible candidates. However, since the resolution does not contain any merger details concerning \"Xã Vũ Quí\", I must respond with an empty array. Providing an empty response signals that the information is absent. My analysis is that there are *no* potential candidates, and attempting to fabricate one would be inaccurate. There is no other logical conclusion.\n",

My task is to examine provided resolutions to find this match.\\n\\nFirst, I break down the request. I need to sift through the provided resolutions, pinpoint *Xã Vũ Quí*, and figure out its new name and location, while providing support by referencing the source.\\n\\nThe old ward details are: *Xã Vũ Quí* (ward), *Huyện Kiến Xương* (district), and *Tỉnh Thái Bình* (province).\\n\\nI start with *Resolution 60-NQ/TW*. This deals with province mergers. I immediately identify that *Tỉnh Thái Bình* is no longer a standalone province; it's been merged into *Tỉnh Hưng Yên*. So, right off the bat, I know that *Xã Vũ Quí* is now likely under *Tỉnh Hưng Yên's* jurisdiction.\\n\\nNext, I turn to *Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15*. This resolution outlines changes within *Tỉnh Hưng Yên*, so it's promising. I go through its *lines* looking for *Xã Vũ Quí* specifically. Unfortunately, it's not mentioned directly.

I analyze the new wards: *Xã Kiến Xương*, *Xã Lê Lợi*, *Xã Quang Lịch*, and *Xã Bình Thanh*.\\n\\nWhile I see several mergers, none of them involve *Xã Vũ Quí*. Because *Xã Vũ Quí* isn't mentioned in the provided resolutions I cannot make a definitive mapping to any of the new wards. Given the limited data, I'm at a confidence level of *low*. It seems the information provided is insufficient.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Vũ Quí, Huyện Kiến Xương, Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 14765,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0031263999999999997,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Processing the Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with a task: to map an old administrative unit, Xã Vũ Quí in Huyện Kiến Xương, Tỉnh Thái Bình, to its new form based on these resolutions. Let's break this down.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the scope. The user provided me with Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW) and some other Resolutions (1666/NQ-UBTVQH15) related to communes within Hưng Yên, along with a list of new wards. The ultimate goal is a JSON output, so I have to keep that in mind.\\\\n\\\\nMy first thought is, \\\\\\\"Where does this old ward even fit into the picture?\\\\\\\" The province, Tỉnh Thái Bình, is mentioned. Right off the bat, I know I need to check the province-level resolution. And there it is: `60-NQ/TW`, item 6, clearly states that Tỉnh Thái Bình merged with Hưng Yên. So, the new ward, without a doubt, must be in Hưng Yên. This is a crucial first step.\\\\n\\\\nNow, on to the specifics. I've got to analyze the provided resolution, `1666/NQ-UBTVQH15`, since it specifically deals with merging of communes and wards. \\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\" is the name I'm hunting for. Unfortunately, after carefully scanning all the mentions of Kiến Xương, I can see that this particular commune isn't included in the merges listed in the provided document. I can't find a direct connection between the old name and any new administrative units.\\\\n\\\\nAt this point, I've got a province merger (Tỉnh Thái Bình -> Tỉnh Hưng Yên), and I can confirm that the district, Huyện Kiến Xương, is being addressed in this resolution, though the specific commune of \\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\" is not mentioned.  The resolutions seem incomplete concerning this old administrative unit. The output is a \\\\\\\"low confidence\\\\\\\" as no direct connection could be established.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí, Huyện Kiến Xương, Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 15473,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0031689,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Initial Assessment & Problem Decomposition**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants me to map an old Vietnamese address (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí, Huyện Kiến Xương, Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") to its new administrative unit. I need to consider province-level mergers and ward-level changes within Hưng Yên, specifically based on the provided resolutions: 60-NQ/TW and 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15. The output has to be a valid JSON array adhering to a specific schema. I understand the constraints: no comments, strict schema compliance, citations where available, confidence level (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), and complete information for the new unit (province, code, and name).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Analyzing & Navigating the Resolutions**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to analyze the old province. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to check resolution 60-NQ/TW for province-level changes. Aha, it's merged with Hưng Yên! (Line 6: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hưng Yên và tỉnh Thái Bình, lấy tên là tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). So, the new province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the old district \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kiến Xương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the old ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are important context. The fact that the problem mentions all districts are eliminated means I have to look to the ward level and focus on resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15 for the *new* province, Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI need to meticulously scan the lines of 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, looking for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I start reading through the provided lines. Nothing jumps out as a direct merge or renaming of the old ward. I was looking for a clear mention, but instead found other merges in Kiến Xương.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Evaluation & Conclusion**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, the old province is now part of Hưng Yên. I have to admit, I'm a little stumped on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I don't see any explicit information on its new name. The resolution mentions Kiến Xương, confirming I'm in the right district, but not the ward I was looking for. There is the note that a small number of wards were kept unchanged. However, given that I can't find a line that explicitly maps \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I cannot be sure. The problem *also* states to indicate low confidence if I am unsure. Therefore, I need to output a JSON with a confidence level of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I'm unable to provide the other details (the new ward's code and name) because the information isn't available.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí, Huyện Kiến Xương, Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 7968,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0028914,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Vietnamese Administrative Landscape**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tackling this address mapping task. It's a bit of a puzzle, but here's how I'm approaching it. First, I break down the old address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kiến Xương,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My mission is to translate this into the contemporary administrative structure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nStep one is the province. I've got to consult those resolutions and quickly spot that 60-NQ/TW states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" have merged. So, the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" becomes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Simple enough – that's a high-confidence finding.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe ward level is where things get a little tricky. I dive into 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, the resolution for restructuring \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tỉnh Hưng Yên's\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" administrative units. I search diligently for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kiến Xương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the context of ward changes. I see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kiến Xương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mentioned, but crucially, I don't see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I see lines mentioning the merging of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hòa Bình (huyện Kiến Xương)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vũ Lễ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to become \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Quang Lịch.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But crucially, there's no mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis is the sticking point. The lack of explicit information about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the relevant resolutions is a major issue. Since 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15 is specific to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"tỉnh Hưng Yên,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" there's a strong chance any changes to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *should* be reflected here. The data's absence means I can't definitively state its current status. It might have been renamed, merged, split, or remained unchanged. I simply *don't know* based on the provided material.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe province mapping is solid; it's a straightforward merger. However, mapping \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a low-confidence situation. I cannot offer a definitive new ward because the necessary information is missing from the provided documents. The instructions are clear – if the data is insufficient, I have to reflect that uncertainty. Therefore, based on what I have, I'll have to indicate a lack of available candidate.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"6.

The provided address is: Xã Vũ Quí (Ward), Huyện Kiến Xương (District), Tỉnh Thái Bình (Province).  My expert knowledge in administrative restructuring kicks in immediately.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to break down the problem.  The initial step is to isolate the components: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kiến Xương,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Now, I consult the available resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW is my starting point for provincial changes.  I quickly locate \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and confirm the merger: it's now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (as detailed in section \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). So far, so good. The Province transformation is clear and straightforward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I dive into Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key for ward-level adjustments within the newly formed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My focus narrows to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kiến Xương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and, crucially, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I meticulously scan the text, line by line.  This is where things get tricky.  Lines 79, 80, and 83 all mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Kiến Xương,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but none explicitly mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Line 81 discusses the merging of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hòa Bình (huyện Kiến Xương)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vũ Lễ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quang Lịch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  However, and this is critical, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* listed in this consolidation.  This strongly suggests that the provided data *doesn't* contain a specific resolution about the status of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis is a key hurdle. The data *doesn't* give me enough information to definitively tell you what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It may have merged elsewhere not included in these provided resolutions, or possibly remained unchanged. But I can't be sure with the data I have.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, the province's transition to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is certain based on the clear statement in Resolution 60-NQ/TW. However, the fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is unknown within the provided context. I have to report a *low confidence* in the ward's new status because the available resolutions don't cover it.  This translates directly to how I structure the JSON output. Since \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vũ Quí\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is not mentioned in the relevant ward restructuring resolutions, I can't provide a specific corresponding ward. This is because the instructions tell me to indicate \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" when insufficient information is available, or when I am unsure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"6.
