  "thought": "**Analyzing the Ward Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, the user wants me to map an old administrative unit to a new one based on these resolutions. Let's break this down. First, the old ward is Xã Kim Chung in Huyện Hưng Hà, Tỉnh Thái Bình. The job is to analyze the resolutions and figure out the new ward, and if there are multiple possibilities, list them with confidence levels. The output should be a JSON array.\n\nI need to start with the province changes. Based on resolution 60-NQ/TW, Tỉnh Thái Bình has become part of Tỉnh Hưng Yên. So, the search now involves resolutions for Tỉnh Hưng Yên, the new province.\n\nI'll scan the provided resolutions for mentions of \"Xã Kim Chung,\" \"Huyện Hưng Hà,\" and \"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\" Resolution 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Hà Nội) doesn't seem relevant. Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Hưng Yên) is the important one. It details reorganizations within Huyện Hưng Hà, but I'm looking for \"Xã Kim Chung.\"\n\nNow, line 71 mentions \"Kim Trung\" instead of \"Kim Chung\". I need to carefully reread the entire resolution. It looks like \"Huyện Hưng Hà\" is indeed affected, and the resolution describes several new wards like Hưng Hà, Tiên La, Lê Quý Đôn, Thần Khê, Diên Hà, Ngự Thiên, and Long Hưng. However, \"Xã Kim Chung\" doesn't appear in any of them.\n\nResolutions 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Nghệ An) and 1682/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tây Ninh) are irrelevant, so I don't need to consider them.\n\nBased on the evidence, the resolutions don't provide a direct mapping for \"Xã Kim Chung.\" It's possible that the ward wasn't affected by the reorganisation described, that there's a typo in the original information, or that the relevant information is in some other resolution I don't have.\n\nSince the prompt explicitly says \"Make sure to include all possible candidates\" and the user is an expert, I conclude that there's simply no information in these documents about where Xã Kim Chung has moved to and must return an empty array, or return low confidence and indicate that the unit was not found. I return `[]`.\n",

Resolution `1656/NQ-UBTVQH15` was quickly dismissed as it pertained to Hanoi, not Hưng Yên.  Resolution `1666/NQ-UBTVQH15`, related to Hưng Yên, was my primary target.

While \\\"Kim Trung\\\" is present and very similar, the wording of my task requires precision.\\n\\nI considered the possibility that the user's input might have a typo, but based on the current data, I can't definitively conclude that. It is also possible, less likely, that \\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\" is one of the few wards not explicitly impacted by the resolutions.\\n\\nGiven the information at hand, I have to conclude that a new administrative unit for \\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\" cannot be found in these documents.

I quickly dismissed `1656/NQ-UBTVQH15` as irrelevant because it deals with Hà Nội, not Hưng Yên. Then, I zeroed in on `1666/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which pertains to Hưng Yên. This is where things got interesting.\\\\n\\\\nLine 71 of `1666/NQ-UBTVQH15` mentioned a merger: \\\\\\\"Hòa Bình, Minh Khai, Thống Nhất and Kim Trung\\\\\\\" into the new \\\\\\\"xã Hưng Hà\\\\\\\".  At first glance, I was hopeful because \\\\\\\"Hưng Hà\\\\\\\" is the district, but I immediately recognized the ward \\\\\\\"Kim Trung\\\\\\\" instead of \\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\". I re-read the entire resolution to be certain. \\\\\\\"Kim Trung\\\\\\\" is definitely the name used. After carefully re-reading the entire document, there were no other references to \\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nBased on this analysis, I'm facing a puzzle. While \\\\\\\"Huyện Hưng Hà\\\\\\\" is clearly present within the new \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\" structure, the specific ward \\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided resolutions.

I have to be absolutely sure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, after a close examination, it doesn't appear that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung, Huyện Hưng Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is directly mentioned in any of the resolutions. This is unexpected. I will double-check my work. Perhaps I misunderstood the merging of provinces or missed a vital detail. I need to be certain that I can't find a direct correlation here.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, let me review the user's initial request and the details of the merge one more time. The province merge is correct. The resolutions available are what is to be used. I will triple-check my work. No, I am correct, it is not mentioned.

My task is to figure out the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung, Huyện Hưng Hà, Tỉnh Thái Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This means I need to trace the evolution of the administrative divisions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and immediately checked for any province mergers as per Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Ah, there it is: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This means \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now the relevant province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I zeroed in on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung, Huyện Hưng Hà.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The key is to see how this particular *xã* (commune) fits into the new *Huyện* (district) landscape within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I'm specifically looking for any references to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hưng Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in subsequent resolutions related to administrative re-organization.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI examined Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key resolution for Hưng Yên.  While it meticulously outlines various mergers and new *xãs* in Hưng Hà, it's immediately apparent that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is not explicitly mentioned in any of the new commune formations.  I went through each section (71-78) carefully, but the name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is absent.  I noted the reference to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which is close but distinct.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGiven the absence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the Hưng Yên resolutions, it becomes clear I need to consider alternative resolutions.  I shift my focus to other resolutions that might mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI checked Resolution 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Hanoi, just to be thorough.  I see a mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in relation to a new *phường* (ward) formation in the district of Hoài Đức. Specifically, a part of Kim Chung is merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Tây Tựu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, based on my analysis of available resolutions,  I can conclude that the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" may be affected by the changes outlined in Resolution 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15. However, since the initial address specifies the old province of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thái Bình,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I would need to further investigate if there was a subsequent move from Thái Bình into the new province of Hưng Yên and also whether the commune was split or re-designated in its entirety.

My process here is fairly straightforward, but requires meticulous checking of the relevant provincial resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and checked Resolution 60-NQ/TW to see if the province underwent any changes. Ah, yes, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hưng Yên và tỉnh Thái Bình, lấy tên là tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" – so, Thái Bình was merged into Hưng Yên. This means I need to focus on Hưng Yên's resolutions now.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I noted the specific ward and district: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hưng Hà.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Now, I need to sift through the Hưng Yên resolutions for any mention of these entities. I zeroed in on Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, a key document.  I meticulously examined each section, especially those dealing with Hưng Hà.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe resolution provides numerous combinations for Hưng Hà's reorganization, resulting in several new entities. I carefully checked each entry related to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Hưng Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", looking for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Sections 71 through 78 outline various mergers and reorganizations within Hưng Hà, forming new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" units. However, none of these sections directly reference \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  I saw close names like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but these are distinct.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, according to Resolution 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15, my initial assumption of a direct, single mapping for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung, Huyện Hưng Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" unit within Hưng Yên is incorrect.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSince I haven't found a resolution directly addressing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within Hưng Yên, I need to broaden my search to other resolutions. Now, I'm checking resolutions looking for the name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I found a relevant one, 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Hà Nội), but it references a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Hoài Đức\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of Hanoi.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, this isn't relevant to my task of finding the new administrative unit for the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" originally in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thái Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It seems I'll need to expand my search significantly, perhaps considering further restructuring plans, or cross-referencing with older archival documents to fully determine the location of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Chung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Hưng Yên và tỉnh Thái Bình, lấy tên là tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hưng Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
