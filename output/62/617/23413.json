My first step is to break down the request. I've got the old administrative unit and need to find the new one, indicating confidence and citing my sources, all in JSON format.\n\nFirst, I analyze the province change. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states Kon Tum merged with Quảng Ngãi. So, the old \"Tỉnh Kon Tum\" is now \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\" This is a key finding.\n\nNext, I dig into the ward-level details. Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Quảng Ngãi, mentions \"xã Tu Mơ Rông\" being created from other wards. The old ward was in a district named Tu Mơ Rông, which is very similar to the name of the new ward. This makes \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" a likely candidate.\n\nHowever, a crucial problem: none of the documents explicitly mention \"Xã Ngọc Yêu\". My confidence is low because I can't definitively link it to the new ward. The association is based on the district/ward name similarities and the reorganization. The fact that resolution 1677 doesn't mention \"Xã Ngọc Yêu\" specifically is a problem. The old \"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông\" is *gone*, but this means the district was reorganized. I infer that the wards were restructured.\n\nThe old database lists the \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" new ward with code \"23425\" in Quảng Ngãi.\n\nMy final output is a JSON object with \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" as the likely new ward, low confidence, and a citation to resolution 1677, which reorganized the wards, supporting my claim, even though it doesn't mention the old ward. The citation is the best source I have to map from old to new.\n",

This is a classic case of navigating changes due to boundary adjustments and mergers, something I'm well-versed in.\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the task. Essentially, I have to sift through these resolutions, pin down whether *Xã Ngọc Yêu* is mentioned anywhere, identify the new ward(s) it's now part of (fully or partially), and then package all that information in a neat JSON format with confidence levels and citations. Standard procedure.\\n\\nI start by analyzing what I have. I know the old ward's name and its district and province. Then I dive into the resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW is key - it details provincial mergers.  A quick scan shows that *Tỉnh Kon Tum* has been swallowed into *Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi*. That's the first major piece of the puzzle. Now I know I'm looking for a ward in *Quảng Ngãi*.\\n\\nNext, I turn to resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15. This one's about Quảng Ngãi. Bingo! I find this gem: \\\"*Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Đăk Hà và xã Tu Mơ Rông thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Tu Mơ Rông*.\\\" This is where things get interesting.  I have to be careful here – the old ward is *Xã Ngọc Yêu, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông*, and the resolution is talking about a *Xã Tu Mơ Rông*. Are they related? Crucially, *Huyện* is a district while *Xã* is a commune. So, no direct link there yet, but *Tu Mơ Rông* is definitely a factor.\\n\\nNow, with the help of the provided database, I'm checking the existing new wards to narrow down the result: one commune called \\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\" and another called \\\"Xã Đăk Hà,\\\" both under the province of \\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\\\" This is where things become contradictory. The resolution clearly states that *Xã Đăk Hà* and *Xã Tu Mơ Rông* were merged into a *new* *Xã Tu Mơ Rông*. This implies that the old communes are no longer existing in their original form.  Therefore, it's strange that the database lists a separate *Xã Đăk Hà*. Maybe it's a new or separate commune, or a mistake in the database entries.\\n\\nThe situation is tricky because *Xã Ngọc Yêu* isn't mentioned in the resolutions explicitly. I will need to consider the changes to *Xã Đăk Hà* and *Xã Tu Mơ Rông* to understand the situation fully, along with any relevant data available on the new communes in *Quảng Ngãi*.\\n\\nMy confidence isn't sky-high yet, but I'm getting there. I'll need to double-check my interpretations, looking out for further details and to assess the most probable outcome.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 14357,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0027945999999999995,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Address Update**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's what I've got based on the user's request to update the address \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\". I need to find the new administrative unit.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I parsed the old address: Xã Ngọc Yêu (ward), Huyện Tu Mơ Rông (district), and Tỉnh Kon Tum (province).  My initial step is to cross-reference this information with relevant administrative changes.\\\\n\\\\nI immediately checked for province-level changes, specifically referencing Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This confirmed that Tỉnh Kon Tum has been merged into Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi, making the new province name \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\". High confidence there.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I looked at the provided resolution, `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi`. This resolution is crucial because it relates to Quảng Ngãi, the *new* province. The key line here is: \\\\\\\"62. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Đăk Hà và xã Tu Mơ Rông thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tu Mơ Rông**.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe district, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, is mentioned and this resolution mentions merging the wards \\\\\\\"xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" into a new \\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\". However, my concern is the old address is Xã Ngọc Yêu, which is *not* mentioned in this resolution.  \\\\n\\\\nI also have a list of new wards, which are:\\\\n*   {\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"23425\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\"}\\\\n*   {\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"23500\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\"}\\\\n\\\\nThe resolution states a *merger*, but the list shows a new `Xã Tu Mơ Rông` and an `Xã Đăk Hà`. This is a bit contradictory, but I'm assuming the resolution is more authoritative on the merger.  This new `Xã Tu Mơ Rông` (code 23425) appears to be the result of that merge.\\\\n\\\\nMy primary takeaway is that while the province change is clear (Kon Tum -> Quảng Ngãi), the situation with \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" is more complicated. The resolution provides the merging information, but no specific confirmation if \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\" or the old \\\\\\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" were affected. The user will need to confirm the district/ward update with another source.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 7027,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0025421,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**My Analysis of Address Mapping for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with the task of figuring out where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now, using the provided resolutions and new ward data.  Here's my thinking:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the original elements: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the old ward and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the old province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I immediately checked the province resolutions (like 60-NQ/TW) and found that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So, right away, the new province becomes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the trickier part:  I needed to see what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *within* the context of this new province.  The relevant resolution (1677/NQ-UBTVQH15) seems to deal specifically with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It mentions the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and... \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is throwing me off a bit because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" appears in the old and the new. But I am looking for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI carefully reviewed the provided \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.  I found \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" listed as new wards under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I can't find *any* mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", though.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I have a problem. The data is not giving me a clear successor.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is where the limitations become clear. Based on the resolutions and the provided new ward data, I can't definitively determine the new ward code or name for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The original ward isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the information. Since I can't find any direct mapping or confirmation, I have to rate my confidence as low. While I know the province has changed, mapping a specific new ward seems impossible. I could not reliably set the data fields as null because the schema does not allow it.

Pinpoint its current administrative equivalent using these resolutions and new ward data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the old province and ward:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Easy enough. Then, I dug into those provincial resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW. This one clarified that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Alright, new province name confirmed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I shifted my focus to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the *new* provincial context, Quảng Ngãi.  The provided \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" primarily feature 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Quảng Ngãi's social unit reshuffling.  My initial scan didn't reveal anything directly referencing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  This resolution *does* mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" a new ward, but formed from a merging of other units. I note that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is present in the original address.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.  I was hoping for a direct match.  These records are limited.  No luck with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" although \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is there with a new province association.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the conundrum.  While the province transition is clear, the fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is murky.  No explicit mention, no clear successor, and no easy way to associate it with an existing \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New ward\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is a real headache.  It seems the old address uses names that are also new names.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy confidence in an accurate mapping? Pretty low. The schema demands a ward code and name, and, realistically, I can't generate a definitive new ward for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Yêu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from this data alone.  We need more information here. I'm thinking further historical data or perhaps a more detailed spatial analysis.
