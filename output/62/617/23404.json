  "thought": "**Processing the Request: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I've got to map this old ward, \"Xã Ngọc Lây, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, Tỉnh Kon Tum,\" to its modern equivalent using these resolutions. First, I need to understand what's being asked: find the new location, document how sure I am, and provide the sources in a neat JSON format.\n\nFirst, I look at the old ward details. I've got the name, the district, and the province.  I immediately focus on \"Tỉnh Kon Tum\" and the resolutions about provinces.  Ah, here we go: \"Tỉnh Kon Tum\" is now part of \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi,\" a key piece of information! That's my starting point.\n\nNext, I dig into the resolution for \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\" It deals with the rearrangement of communes/wards.  I notice something interesting: a new \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" is mentioned. This piques my interest because the old ward was in \"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông.\" However, the resolution specifically merges \"Xã Đăk Hà\" and the original \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" to create this new entity. It doesn't actually *mention* \"Xã Ngọc Lây.\" I'm starting to see a potential problem.\n\nI then check the database of new wards. \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" is indeed there, now in \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi,\" confirming the province change. But I'm still stuck on \"Xã Ngọc Lây.\" The resolution gives me no help.\n\nOkay, let's step back and think. I know \"Tỉnh Kon Tum\" is now \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\" No problem there. The problem is \"Xã Ngọc Lây.\" There's no *direct* mention of it in any of the resolutions.  The prompt says to find *possible* matches.\n\nI re-read the resolutions. They focus on the merging of specific communes. Nothing confirms \"Xã Ngọc Lây\" is absorbed. The resolution talks about the old \"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông,\" but only in reference to what used to be a commune within it, that no longer exists in its old form.  The new \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" is a likely candidate given the connection to the old \"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông,\" especially since the user is removing districts from the map. It's a plausible guess that this district-level entity was split up, and maybe, just *maybe*, \"Xã Ngọc Lây\" is now part of the new ward of the same name. But I don't have enough evidence.  I have to report a low confidence rating.\n\nI have to be honest here; I don't know for certain. The resolution doesn't give a definite answer. But, I *do* see a pattern that suggests the new \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" could be a candidate. So, I will propose \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\" with \"low\" confidence, cite the province merger resolution as the primary source, and make sure my JSON output reflects this uncertainty.\n\nSo, my JSON will include \"Xã Tu Mơ Rông,\" but the confidence level will be \"low,\" because the evidence is circumstantial.  I'll cite the merger of Kon Tum with Quảng Ngãi to be explicit on the confidence rating. I have enough here to create the JSON object. This is as good as it gets, given the data at hand.\n",

First, the old \\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\" is now part of \\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\" – that's a straightforward shift according to 60-NQ/TW, and it's a high-confidence match.  However, the ward and district situation is less definitive.\\n\\nI've examined the resolutions carefully.

I'm noting the district \\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông\\\" from the old data, but I understand districts are being eliminated in this process.\\n\\nGiven the existing information, I can't definitively connect \\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\" to any specific new ward.

I've got the ward, district, and province: \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\" respectively.\\\\n\\\\nMy initial step was to check for any province mergers. From what I can see, \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\" is now part of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\" based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This immediately narrows down the search area to Quảng Ngãi.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I examined the provided resolution, `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15`, focused on Quảng Ngãi's administrative changes. I focused on any mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\". My initial scan revealed a key passage about merging \\\\\\\"xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" into a new \\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông.\\\\\\\" While the old district \\\\\\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" is reflected in the new ward name, importantly, *Xã Ngọc Lây* is *not* mentioned in the resolution.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the data I have, I noted the new wards: \\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\" - both within Quảng Ngãi. \\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" is intriguing given the district's presence in the old address. \\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Hà's\\\\\\\" presence is also interesting, although I must be careful not to conflate this ward with the old \\\\\\\"xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\" mentioned in the resolution which was merged into the new Tu Mo Rong.\\\\n\\\\nHere's the problem: I've got the province change, and I see the creation of the new \\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông.\\\\\\\" However, there's no direct confirmation that \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\" was incorporated into this new ward. The provided resolution is silent on Ngọc Lây's fate.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, while the new \\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" is *the most likely candidate* within Quảng Ngãi - especially because the district's name and the new ward name are aligned - I can't definitively state that \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\" is now part of this new ward. Additional information regarding \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\" is needed to confirm this. The user is asking for possible solutions, so I will recommend the new \\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\" as the likely mapping, but with the caveat that it is not a guaranteed mapping based on the provided data.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"23425\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 8568,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0029395999999999997,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Assessing the Ward Mapping**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with an address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, Tỉnh Kon Tum,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to figure out its new administrative unit (ward) based on these resolutions and a list of new wards.  My initial thought is to break this down step-by-step.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, the province and ward: the old ward is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I'll need to see how these names translate under the new structure.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I turn to the province resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW.  Ah, Kon Tum is *merged* into Quảng Ngãi! Now we're looking at \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" instead. Good, that part is relatively straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I dig into the other resolution, 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one dealing with restructuring in Quảng Ngãi.  I'm scanning for any mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" directly, but I'm not seeing it. However, I notice \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mentioned in the context of a merger with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form a *new* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  That's interesting since the *old* address includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI quickly check the list of new wards, and I see a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" listed under Quảng Ngãi, and also a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Hà.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's where it gets tricky.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in any of the resolutions.  The resolutions only detail the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tu Mơ Rông.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I understand that Tu Mơ Rông is both an old huyện and a new xã, so there might be a connection here, but the data is just not explicit. This leaves me to infer a bit, but I have no concrete evidence.\\\\\\\\nConsidering the address information and the merging details, I have to assume the province has changed, and since I cannot find any new reference to the name 'Ngọc Lây', the solution needs to state that the ward is not directly identifiable.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, the province name will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the ward name will remain unknown, based on the provided information and the lack of a clear mapping for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I have to be cautious about making assumptions here, given the data at hand.

My task is to figure out the new ward for the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây, Huyện Tu Mơ Rông, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  I'll start by pinpointing the relevant province and ward names.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm diving into the resolutions. First, I need to check the province resolutions – specifically, 60-NQ/TW.  Ah, here it is: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Kon Tum và tỉnh Quảng Ngãi, lấy tên là tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This tells me that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". High-confidence information here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I'll move on to resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, since it deals with the administrative changes within Quảng Ngãi.  Let's see...  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"62. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Đăk Hà và xã Tu Mơ Rông thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tu Mơ Rông**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Hmm, interesting.  The resolution mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and also \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - both are merged into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Crucially, my old ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in this resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, let's examine the list of new wards.  I have two options: `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"23425\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}` and `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"23500\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Hà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`.  Still no direct mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTime for a careful analysis.  The province change is clear:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" –  a very solid connection. The problem is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  It's nowhere to be seen in any of the resolutions or the new ward list. I see that the original address includes the phrase \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This might hint that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was part of it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe resolutions describe a merge involving a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but it refers to *another ward* in the past. There's no concrete link for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to those actions. It is therefore uncertain what is the new place of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". We do have \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a new ward within Quảng Ngãi. It's possible \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged into it (or another ward), but it's not explicitly confirmed. This requires a low confidence output because of that.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe lack of concrete information presents a challenge. The output then would include the new province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a lack of direct match for the ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ngọc Lây\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Kon Tum và tỉnh Quảng Ngãi, lấy tên là tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"23425\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tu Mơ Rông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
