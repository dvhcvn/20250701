  "thought": "**Mapping Old to New: A Case of Inference and Incomplete Data**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to figure out where \"Xã Đắk Blô, Huyện Đắk Glei, Tỉnh Kon Tum\" is now, using the provided resolutions. I've got a province merger (Kon Tum into Quảng Ngãi) and a ward restructuring document to work with.\n\n**Step 1:** The easy part - Tỉnh Kon Tum is now part of Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi (thanks to resolution 60-NQ/TW). Huyện Đắk Glei is gone.  So, we're looking for a new location *within* Quảng Ngãi.\n\n**Step 2:** The \"meat\" of the problem lies in the ward restructuring document, 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15.  It explicitly mentions some units from the old Đắk Glei district. For example, the district town \"thị trấn Đăk Glei\" and the old ward \"Xã Đăk Pék\" are merged into the new \"Xã Đăk Pék\". And, critically, some wards like \"Đăk Long\" are listed as *unchanged*.\n\n**Step 3:** Here's the rub. \"Xã Đắk Blô\" isn't *explicitly* mentioned as being merged into anything.  However, it *isn't* on the \"unchanged\" list. This means it *must* have been part of the restructuring. I need to make an inference.\n\n**Step 4:** Logic dictates it was likely merged with another unit from the old Huyện Đắk Glei. The most probable candidate, given the restructuring is \"Xã Đăk Pék\", created by a merger. It's common practice to incorporate nearby wards into a new one.  This is a good candidate to have been merged with it.  Other wards are not nearby. I can list the list of new wards for a potential candidate. It is a good bet for Đắk Blô to have been merged with. However, the data *doesn't* explicitly state this.\n\n**Step 5:** Conclusion: I can *propose* \"Xã Đăk Pék\" as a likely new location, along with \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\". I must flag this with a **\"low\" confidence** because I'm inferring, not directly quoting. This isn't a *fact*, based on the provided data, but the most logical inference. I will cite both resolutions: the province merger (`60-NQ/TW`) and the ward restructuring (`1677/NQ-UBTVQH15`), specifically the line mentioning \"thị trấn Đăk Glei\" and \"xã Đăk Pék\" merging, showing that restructuring *is* happening where \"Xã Đắk Blô\" used to be. I am going to build one JSON object.\n\nSo, here's my proposed answer:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\",\n    \"ward_name\": \"Xã Đăk Pék\",\n    \"ward_code\": \"23341\",\n    \"confidence\": \"low\",\n    \"citation\": {\n      \"header\": \"1677/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\",\n      \"line\": \"70.

I need to be precise here, ensuring I adhere to the specified output format and indicate any uncertainty.\\n\\nFirst, I break down the request: the old ward is clearly defined, and my task is to find its updated equivalent, using the resolutions as my primary source of truth. The output must be a JSON array, conforming to the given schema, and I'm expected to flag low confidence if the information is incomplete. Crucially, I have to cite the relevant resolution and line where direct mappings are found.\\n\\nAnalyzing the information, I start with the details of the old ward. I know it's in Tỉnh Kon Tum, which triggers an investigation into provincial mergers. Resolution 60-NQ/TW clearly states that Kon Tum was merged with Quảng Ngãi to form Quảng Ngãi. So, the new province for Xã Đắk Blô will be Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\\n\\nNow, I shift focus to Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns \\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\\\" This seems relevant because Kon Tum is now part of Quảng Ngãi, and the old ward is in a district that is now part of the new province.\\n\\nI see that the resolution mentions \\\"huyện Đăk Glei,\\\" which is the district containing Xã Đắk Blô, signaling that the resolution is relevant. However, the resolution doesn't explicitly state the changes to all communes. It deals with the consolidation of \\\"thị trấn Đăk Glei\\\" and \\\"xã Đăk Pék\\\" into a new \\\"xã Đăk Pék.\\\" Line 92 lists several wards that remained unchanged, but Xã Đắk Blô isn't on that list. This suggests it *was* affected by the rearrangement. The number of communes implies some changes took place.\\n\\nMy concern is that the provided text doesn't explicitly state the new designation for Xã Đắk Blô. While I can deduce it's now in Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi, the resolution doesn't clarify the ward's ultimate fate. I see a new Đắk Pék ward created from a merge, and I see unchanged wards explicitly listed.\\n\\nSince the mapping isn't directly evident, I must conclude that the information available is insufficient to definitively state the current status of Xã Đắk Blô. Therefore, I need to generate an output with a low confidence level and explain the ambiguity. I will need to acknowledge the uncertainty regarding its new status.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Đắk Blô, Huyện Đắk Glei, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 18857,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0032606,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Analyzing the Administrative Unit Mapping**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's my breakdown of this mapping task. I'm focusing on finding the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô, Huyện Đắk Glei, Tỉnh Kon Tum.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the user's request.  They've given me an old ward (\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\"), its district (\\\\\\\"Huyện Đắk Glei\\\\\\\"), and province (\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\"). My job is to find its equivalent *now*, considering those pesky resolutions: `60-NQ/TW` and `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15`. I know the output needs to be a JSON array, stick to the specified schema, and crucially, maintain a high level of confidence wherever possible. The elimination of districts is a key constraint to consider.\\\\n\\\\nI see that the old ward is \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô,\\\\\\\" which falls under the district of \\\\\\\"Huyện Đắk Glei\\\\\\\" and the province of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum.\\\\\\\"  The challenge here is to figure out the changes based on these resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nI began by tackling the provincial changes first, as that will likely have a cascading effect.  `60-NQ/TW` indicates that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\" was *merged* with \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi,\\\\\\\" forming \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\\\\\\\"  Straightforward enough; that's a high-confidence mapping. **This means \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\" is now a part of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\" - a fundamental first step.**\\\\n\\\\nNow the ward-level analysis. I need to focus on resolution `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15`. That one specifically deals with administrative changes in Quảng Ngãi (which now encompasses the former Kon Tum).  The resolutions specifically focuses on \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\", that is re-arranging the wards in this province.\\\\n\\\\nI'm carefully scanning `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15`, looking for any mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\" or even its old district, \\\\\\\"Huyện Đắk Glei\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nI found line 70, which discusses a merge between \\\\\\\"thị trấn Đăk Glei\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Đăk Pék\\\\\\\" into a new \\\\\\\"xã Đăk Pék\\\\\\\". It's a key find. Then, in line 92, a list of wards not affected by the rearrangement is given.  I don't see \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\" mentioned in either the merge instructions or the list of unchanged wards.\\\\n\\\\nThis is where things get tricky.  While I can confidently map the province, the specific fate of \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\" is unclear from the provided information. The resolutions seem focused on Quảng Ngãi's wards but provide no clear information about my specific target ward.\\\\n\\\\n**Synthesizing the Information:**\\\\n\\\\n*   Province change:  \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\" -> \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\" (High Confidence, based on `60-NQ/TW`)\\\\n*   Ward change:  Unknown for \\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô.\\\\\\\"  It's not listed as merged, split, or unchanged in resolution `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15`.\\\\n\\\\nI have a significant information gap about what happened to the specific ward, while I can confidently map the province. This demands a low-confidence rating for the ward's remapping.

Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15 then becomes relevant since it specifically addresses the reorganization of communes in Quảng Ngãi.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy scan of the resolution turned up two pertinent facts. The formation of a new commune, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Pék,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by combining \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Đăk Glei\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đăk Pék.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Since Đăk Glei appears in my original address, this restructuring warrants further scrutiny. The second relevant piece mentions unchanged communes in the district: Đắk Long. Critically, my input, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is not in this list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe information suggests two possibilities, but the text isn't explicit. Given the merging of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Đăk Glei,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the lack of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" among the unchanged communes, it's highly likely that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was subject to reorganization.  It could have merged with another commune, been renamed, or been split up.  However, this resolution doesn't provide the conclusive answer.  More data is needed to pinpoint the new unit precisely. The output, thus, requires more external information to conclusively determine the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô, Huyện Đắk Glei, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8000,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0033081,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Analysis of Address and Relevant Resolutions**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm looking at this old address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô, Huyện Đắk Glei, Tỉnh Kon Tum,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to figure out its new administrative unit. First, I break it down: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Đắk Glei\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the province).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe initial thing that jumps out is the province: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is on the merge list (60-NQ/TW), becoming part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So, I immediately know the new province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I dive into Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, which is all about rearranging communes in Quảng Ngãi. I scan it carefully. I see a line (line 70) merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Đăk Glei\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đăk Pék\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đăk Pék,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which seems promising, given the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Glei\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" connection. However, I note that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Đăk Glei\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't the same as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". That line isn't directly relevant.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then check line 92, which lists communes *not* undergoing changes. These are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Long,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ba Xa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rờ Kơi,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mô Rai,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ia Đal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't in that list, which suggests it *has* changed. But the question is: how? The districts mentioned are those under rearrangement so my suspicion would be the current ward might also be included.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I checked my list of new wards: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ba Xa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Pék,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Long,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Rờ Kơi,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ia Đal,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mô Rai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" None of them match \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n**The Dilemma**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis is where it gets tricky. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned as remaining unchanged, or merging in 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15.

My initial approach is to break it down:  Old ward is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", District is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Đắk Glei\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and Province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I looked at relevant provincial resolutions.  I immediately saw that Kon Tum was merged into Quảng Ngãi (as stated in Resolution 60-NQ/TW), so \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" becomes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Good start.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I dove into Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key resolution concerning the rearrangement of Quảng Ngãi's communes.  I noticed line 70, which discusses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Đăk Glei\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đăk Pék\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merging into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đăk Pék\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, this doesn't directly help me with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which is the ward I'm focused on.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLine 92 was more relevant, listing communes *not* undergoing changes.  It included \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đăk Long (huyện Đăk Glei), Ba Xa, Rờ Kơi, Mô Rai, Ia Đal.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Unfortunately, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wasn't on this list, suggesting it *did* undergo change.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then carefully checked the provided list of new wards.  I quickly ruled out \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ba Xa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Pék,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đăk Long,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Rờ Kơi,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ia Đal,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mô Rai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as none matched my original ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đắk Blô\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, I'm left with a bit of a puzzle.
