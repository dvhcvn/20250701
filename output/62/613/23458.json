My process involves several key steps:\n\n1.  **Deconstructing the Request:** I recognized the need to analyze resolutions and identify the appropriate new ward(s) given the old ward's details (Măng Buk, Kon Plông, Kon Tum).\n2.  **Province-Level Analysis:** Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Kon Tum merged into Quảng Ngãi. Thus, the old ward is now within the new Quảng Ngãi province. This change is straightforward and gives me high confidence in the province mapping.\n3.  **District and Ward-Level Challenges:**  Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Quảng Ngãi, creates \"Xã Kon Plông,\" the same name as the old district. However, it explicitly states which wards are combined to form the new unit and *doesn't* include \"Xã Măng Buk.\"  This creates a significant problem: while \"Xã Kon Plông\" is a likely candidate given the geographic and name similarities, there's no direct evidence to connect it to the old ward.\n4.  **Assessing Confidence and Formulating the JSON Output:**  Based on this conflicting information, I've concluded that \"Xã Kon Plông\" is a *possible* match, but the confidence level is low. The JSON output reflects this uncertainty, providing the name \"Xã Kon Plông,\" along with the associated ward code and province, but a \"low\" confidence level and the necessary citation from resolution 1677. The cited resolution clarifies the process of creating the new ward and underscores the missing piece of information regarding \"Xã Măng Buk.\" This approach ensures I provide a valid output adhering to the user's request, but also accurately convey the existing ambiguities.\n",

Based on the request, I can assume the user has a good understanding of administrative reorganizations.\\n\\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user provides *resolutions* and a *new ward database*, and wants a JSON output with a confidence level and citation.\\n\\n**Deconstructing the Problem:**\\n\\nLet's dissect this, step by step. I'll need to figure out what happened to *Tỉnh Kon Tum* and *Huyện Kon Plông*.\\n\\n1.  **Province Analysis:** The province is the first step. *Tỉnh Kon Tum* is the old province. Looking at the resolutions, specifically `60-NQ/TW`, I find that *Tỉnh Kon Tum* merged with *Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi*.\\n\\n2.  **District and Ward Scrutiny:** Now, the tricky part – the district and ward. The user hints that all districts have been eliminated during the restructuring process. So, *Huyện Kon Plông* no longer exists as an administrative level. The *Xã Măng Buk* ward must be reassigned. Looking at resolution `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15`, *Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi*, it clearly deals with the province's new wards. However, the specific line provided only mentions the merger of three other communes to form *Xã Kon Plông*.\\n\\n3.  **Synthesizing and Assessing Confidence:**\\n\\n    *   I know the province changed from *Kon Tum* to *Quảng Ngãi*, a straightforward process.\\n    *   I'm also aware that the old district no longer exists.\\n    *   I have a hint in that there is a newly formed *Xã Kon Plông* in the same province. It's likely that communes from the old *Huyện Kon Plông* were absorbed into it.\\n    *   However, the provided text doesn't explicitly link *Xã Măng Buk* to this new commune.\\n\\nBased on this information, I can't say for sure *Xã Măng Buk* is part of the new *Xã Kon Plông*. My analysis is limited by the provided information. I *suspect* a link, but I don't have enough evidence for high confidence.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"23476\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Kon Plông\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Măng Buk, Huyện Kon Plông, Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 18633,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0040032,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Analyzing and Mapping Vietnamese Administrative Changes**\\\\n\\\\nAlright, let's break this down. The user wants me to map an old Vietnamese address to its new location. I'm given an old address – `Xã Măng Buk, Huyện Kon Plông, Tỉnh Kon Tum` – and a couple of resolutions. My task is to figure out the corresponding new ward and format the output as JSON, including a confidence level.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I look at the province. The address is in `Tỉnh Kon Tum`.  Resolution `60-NQ/TW` reveals that `Tỉnh Kon Tum` merged with `Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi` to become... `Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi`. That's a high-confidence match.  So far, so good.\\\\n\\\\nNow for the tricky part: the ward and district. The old address has `Xã Măng Buk` in `Huyện Kon Plông`.  The user has indicated that district is eliminated. This means the ward is the key. I review resolution `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which details ward changes in `Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi`.  Line 81 in that resolution creates a new ward called \\\\\\\"**xã Kon Plông**\\\\\\\" by merging `Ngọk Tem`, `Hiếu`, and `Pờ Ê`. This is interesting because the old district was also named `Kon Plông`, so there's a good chance this is the new location. However, and this is crucial, the specific ward I'm looking for - `Xã Măng Buk` - is *not* mentioned in the resolution.\\\\n\\\\nBased on what I know, there are two possibilities.\\\\n\\\\n1.  My data set is incomplete. It's possible that `Xã Măng Buk` merged into some other ward and resolution, which I do not have access to.\\\\n\\\\n2.  The district name may have been reused when new wards were established, and not specific ward changes were mentioned.\\\\n\\\\nSo, I can't be *certain* that `Xã Măng Buk` directly corresponds to `Xã Kon Plông` based solely on the text I have. I know the province is now `Quảng Ngãi`, and I have data for the new `Xã Kon Plông`.\\\\n\\\\nThat means I'll have to set the `confidence` to \\\\\\\"low.\\\\\\\" The output should include `province_name` as \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi,\\\\\\\"  `ward_name` as \\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông,\\\\\\\" and the associated `ward_code`.  The `citation` will be the resolution and the specific line creating the new ward.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1677/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"81.

My task is to map this to a new administrative unit based on these resolutions.  First, I've got to decode the old structure.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old province, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the district.  The prompt's guidance is to eliminate districts so, I expect to see integration within province or ward levels.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe first resolution, 60-NQ/TW, states that Kon Tum merges with Quảng Ngãi.  Therefore, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" becomes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Pretty straightforward so far.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow the complexity begins.  I need to find a resolution involving \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The only other relevant resolution, 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerns Quảng Ngãi.  Here, they're forming a new ward called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ngọk Tem\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hiếu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pờ Ê\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Interestingly, the old district of my original address is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and the new ward shares the same name, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  A potential correlation arises. However, the resolution *does not* include \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the formation of the new ward.  This creates doubt.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI then check the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.  There it is: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is indeed a new ward within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Confirming the resolution's creation.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe mapping becomes difficult.  I know the province changed from Kon Tum to Quảng Ngãi.  I know a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" exists. I see the name of my original address' district, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" used as the new ward's name. However, the resolution that created it *doesn't* include the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", nor does it suggest \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the foundation of the new ward. Without explicit confirmation, I cannot confidently link \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or any other new ward based on these resolutions alone. There just isn't enough information to be sure.  I'd need more details on the specific boundaries or consolidation plans to make a conclusive match.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Kon Tum và tỉnh Quảng Ngãi, lấy tên là tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1677/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"81.

First, I need to break it down. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old district (which is apparently being eliminated), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy initial thought is to check the province resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW is clear: Kon Tum merges into Quảng Ngãi. So, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Kon Tum\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". That part is straightforward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to see what's happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Looking through the resolutions, I find 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, which talks about reorganizing Quảng Ngãi's wards. This resolution mentions a new ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", formed from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ngọk Tem\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hiếu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pờ Ê\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Hmm, the old address also has \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in it. I have to be careful here, the *district* is called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the *new ward* is called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but the resolution forming \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The wording of the resolution makes it clear the changes are happening *within* the context of Quảng Ngãi, which Kon Tum *becomes*.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nChecking the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data confirms the existence of this \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Quảng Ngãi.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem: While the district and new ward share a name and the province is changing, I don't see any explicit connection between \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The resolution forming \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" names only \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ngọk Tem\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hiếu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Pờ Ê\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Therefore, I can't confidently map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Măng Buk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kon Plông\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or any other known new ward based on the information I have.
