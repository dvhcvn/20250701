  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Changes**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an old address: \"Xã Bình Sơn, Huyện Hòn Đất, Tỉnh Kiên Giang.\"  My task is to pinpoint its new administrative unit.  Given my expertise in this field, I'm going to systematically work through this.\n\nFirst, I break down the old address:  \"Xã Bình Sơn\" (ward), \"Huyện Hòn Đất\" (district), \"Tỉnh Kiên Giang\" (province).  The key here is that provinces often undergo consolidation and reorganization, as I'm well aware.\n\nMy initial thought is to examine the province resolutions.  I've got Resolution 60-NQ/TW to check first.  Ah, yes, this resolution indicates that Kiên Giang has been merged with An Giang to form a new, single province called An Giang.  So, right off the bat, I know we're dealing with \"Tỉnh An Giang.\"\n\nNow, I shift my focus to the other relevant resolutions, specifically looking for mentions of \"Xã Bình Sơn\" within \"Tỉnh An Giang\" or within those resolutions pertaining to administrative changes.  I pull up Resolution 1654/NQ-UBTVQH15.  I scan the document carefully, noting any mentions of \"Huyện Hòn Đất\" since it's part of the original address. I see the mention of \"thị trấn Hòn Đất\" being rearranged, but this doesn't directly address \"Xã Bình Sơn.\"  However, there's a vital line 97 that stands out. It *explicitly* lists \"Xã Bình Sơn\" among the communes *not* undergoing rearrangement.  Bingo! That's a huge clue.  The document says it is one of the 6 xã that didn't get rearranged. That's extremely significant.\n\nI need to confirm my findings.  I quickly cross-reference that against my list of new wards looking for \"Xã Bình Sơn\" and \"Tỉnh An Giang.\"  And there it is: a perfect match!\n\nTherefore, my initial assessment strongly suggests that the new ward is indeed \"Xã Bình Sơn\" within the province of \"Tỉnh An Giang.\" My confidence level is high because of the explicit mention of this unit not being rearranged.\n\nI always like to double-check, though. To be absolutely sure, I'll quickly scan for \"Xã Bình Sơn\" mentions in resolutions for *other* provinces to eliminate any potential confusion from similarly named entities. I can see that there are others with similar names, but they are from other provinces. This further solidifies my confidence.  I'm good to go with my conclusion.\n",
