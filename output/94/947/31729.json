  "thought": "**Analyzing and Mapping Administrative Units**\n\nOkay, here's what I'm thinking. The user wants me to translate an old administrative unit, \"Xã Hòa Tú II, Huyện Mỹ Xuyên, Tỉnh Sóc Trăng,\" into its new form. I need to comb through these resolutions and figure out where this place went.\n\nFirst, I looked at the province level. That was easy. Resolution 60-NQ/TW tells me Sóc Trăng is now part of Cần Thơ. That's a good start!\n\nNext, I had to dig into the finer details. I scanned the \"Other Resolutions,\" focusing on Cần Thơ since that's the new province. I noticed Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, which mentions \"Mỹ Xuyên,\" the district from the old ward. This resolution creates a new \"phường Mỹ Xuyên.\" I have to see if this matches with my old ward's name and location.\n\nNow, here's the catch. The resolution *doesn't* specifically mention \"Xã Hòa Tú II.\" It talks about \"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên.\" Given that the old \"Xã Hòa Tú II\" was in \"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\" and that this resolution is about creating a new \"Phường Mỹ Xuyên,\" it's likely they're related. However, since the resolution doesn't have an explicit reference, I can't be 100% sure. Maybe the source text is incomplete.\n\nSo, I checked the new wards list and found that \"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\" exists in \"Thành phố Cần Thơ\". That’s a match for my initial thought. Since it’s a reasonable deduction based on the name correlation and province change. It is plausible that the old \"Xã Hòa Tú II\" is incorporated into this new ward, but the resolution doesn't *explicitly* state that. \n\nTherefore, I'm going to propose \"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\" as the new unit, but I have to be honest and mark the confidence as \"low\" because of the lack of a direct confirmation. I will base my citation on the line from Resolution 1668, the relevant resolution. I will also have to include a general province header to provide context. The JSON array output will reflect this analysis, highlighting the uncertainty.\n",

I need to figure out the current administrative unit for \\\"Xã Hòa Tú II, Huyện Mỹ Xuyên, Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\". My first step is to analyze the input: we're dealing with an old ward, district, and province.\\n\\nBased on my understanding of recent administrative changes, I know that Sóc Trăng underwent a significant shift. Looking at the province-level resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW, I see that Sóc Trăng was merged with Hậu Giang to become Cần Thơ. This is confirmed by resolution `1668/NQ-UBTVQH15`. Therefore, the new province is now \\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\".\\n\\nNow, I'll need to focus on ward-level resolutions to figure out if and where \\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\" ended up. Scanning through the provided resolutions, I found `1668/NQ-UBTVQH15` to be the most promising. It details the formation of \\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\" within Cần Thơ, and importantly, it mentions the old district, \\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\". However, the resolution *specifically* states the formation of \\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\" comes from the merger of \\\"Phường 10, thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên và xã Đại Tâm\\\".  I note here that `Xã Hòa Tú II` is not mentioned.\\n\\nExamining the \\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\" ward list, I see \\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\" as a potential candidate, given its connection to the old \\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\". Logically, it would seem reasonable that wards in the old district might have been consolidated into the new unit, but the resolution doesn't explicitly confirm that. It's possible that \\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\" was merged into a different, new unit. It's difficult to make a concrete conclusion without further information.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Thành phố Cần Thơ\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"31684\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Hòa Tú II, Huyện Mỹ Xuyên, Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 14278,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0028737999999999997,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Processing the Request: Finding the New Administrative Unit**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so the user wants me to figure out the new administrative location for \\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II, Huyện Mỹ Xuyên, Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\". My first step is to break down the request. I know I have a ward (Xã Hòa Tú II), a district (Huyện Mỹ Xuyên), and a province (Tỉnh Sóc Trăng) to work with.\\\\n\\\\nThe user mentioned all districts are being eliminated, so I need to find out what happened to Sóc Trăng.  A quick check of the relevant province mergers tells me that Sóc Trăng was merged with Hậu Giang into Cần Thơ. That's a crucial piece of information.  So, the new province will be \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to check for any specific resolutions that might mention Hòa Tú II, Mỹ Xuyên, or Sóc Trăng.  I'm focusing on the \\\\\\\"Other resolutions,\\\\\\\" scanning each line.\\\\n\\\\nThe first few resolutions were dead ends: An Giang, Hà Nội, and Hà Tĩnh.  Then I hit Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Cần Thơ). Bingo! This one's relevant.  Line 25 mentions the \\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\" being merged into a new \\\\\\\"phường Mỹ Xuyên.\\\\\\\"  This is highly relevant!  Since Hòa Tú II was in the same old district (\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\") as thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên, there's a good chance Hòa Tú II's fate is connected.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I'll switch my focus to the new wards list for \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\" I'm looking for a ward that seems like a match for the old \\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II.\\\\\\\" Two new wards came up: Xã Thạnh Phú and Phường Mỹ Xuyên. The latter, \\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên,\\\\\\\" jumps out at me as the most promising.

The user wants the updated administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II, Huyện Mỹ Xuyên, Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". First, I need to analyze the input: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (District), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Province).  My initial step is to determine what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Based on my knowledge and the relevant resolutions, particularly Resolution 60-NQ/TW, it's clear that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I have to find where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" fit within the new structure of Cần Thơ. I'm going to carefully scan through the available resolutions, looking for any changes or reorganizations involving those names.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResolution 1654/NQ-UBTVQH15 and 1656/NQ-UBTVQH15 are distractions, mentioning \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but in An Giang and Hà Nội, respectively.  Resolution 1665/NQ-UBTVQH15 from Hà Tĩnh is irrelevant. Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15 is the key because it relates to Cần Thơ. This resolution creates a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and some other units. The mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is crucial because it was the old administrative unit within the very district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") of the original address. This indicates that a reorganization is happening.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWhile the resolution *doesn't* explicitly mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", it strongly suggests that the old units from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are being restructured within Cần Thơ.  Given this and the fact that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is being transformed, it's very likely that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is also affected. I then scanned the list of new wards created by the resolutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFrom the new wards list for Cần Thơ, I spot a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Given the context of the district's re-organization, the most plausible scenario is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I can't be *completely* certain without more definitive information that explicitly connects the two, but based on the provided data, this is the most logical conclusion, and it is most likely that the user will be satisfied.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"25.

My task is to determine the corresponding new administrative unit, considering any relevant resolutions and new ward listings.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I break down the address: I know \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the province.  I need to scour the provided resolutions for clues.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nImmediately, I see that the province resolution, specifically 60-NQ/TW, states that Sóc Trăng has been *merged* into Thành phố Cần Thơ. So, right off the bat, I know the new province for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I dig into the other resolutions.  Resolutions 1654, 1656, and 1665 deal with An Giang, Hanoi, and Hà Tĩnh respectively, so those are irrelevant.  Resolution 1668, however, relates to Thành phố Cần Thơ. It's the key.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWithin Resolution 1668, line 25, mentions that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is being merged into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I observe that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a ward-level unit, while my old address uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (a district).  I recognize the name is derived from the district, and a bit of context clues in the resolution implies that this is a *ward-level* arrangement. However, I can't find direct mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". My understanding is that this means no direct ward-level restructuring from the resolution directly applies to the address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Therefore, no direct name change.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I checked my new ward list and confirm that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *is* indeed listed as a new ward within Thành phố Cần Thơ. This further suggests that Thành phố Cần Thơ is the current province, as already concluded.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI need to confirm if there is further information I should consider, but based on the available information, the new address seems to be: **Xã Hòa Tú II, Huyện Mỹ Xuyên, Thành phố Cần Thơ**. Although, if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is an active unit in the municipality, I should consult for potential municipality-level changes, but no direct information supports this claim at the moment.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất thành phố cần Thơ, tỉnh Sóc Trăng và tỉnh Hậu Giang; lấy tên là thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"31684\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n  ],\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II, Huyện Mỹ Xuyên, Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 7662,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0031463,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Identifying the New Administrative Unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this. The user has given me the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II, Huyện Mỹ Xuyên, Tỉnh Sóc Trăng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to figure out its new administrative unit based on the provided resolutions and the new wards list.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I parsed the old address to understand its components: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (province). I know the process involves examining resolutions for changes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI quickly checked the province resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Sóc Trăng is now part of Cần Thơ. So, at least the province is straightforward: it's now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the trickier part. I went through the other resolutions one by one. I dismissed resolutions concerning An Giang, Hà Nội, and Hà Tĩnh since they're irrelevant. Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, however, got my attention because it pertains to Cần Thơ. It includes the line about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being formed from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and others. However, my initial observation is that while this resolution talks about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mỹ Xuyên,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" my old address references \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" - that's a district, not a ward-level unit. Importantly, this resolution *doesn't* mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specifically. It doesn't seem to suggest \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the new ward).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen I looked at the new wards list to verify \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which, indeed, exists. So, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Mỹ Xuyên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is confirmed as a new ward in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGiven the information at hand, I concluded that no resolution directly addresses a change to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hòa Tú II.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The resolutions don't tell me specifically what happened to the ward. I need to keep looking, perhaps a deeper dive is required... I may have to consult other resources.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFor now, I can say with confidence that the new province is Thành phố Cần Thơ.
