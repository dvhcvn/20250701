  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Address Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to figure out the current administrative location of \"Xã Ba Nam, Huyện Ba Tơ, Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\" based on some recent government resolutions and a dataset of new wards.  This is a pretty straightforward process, actually.\n\nFirst, I need to confirm the province and ward from the old address:  We're looking at Quảng Ngãi province and the \"Xã Ba Nam\" ward.  I already know that the province name hasn't changed because of resolution 60-NQ/TW.\n\nNow, the crucial part: I have to check the relevant resolutions to see if \"Xã Ba Nam\" has been affected by any administrative adjustments.  I'm going to scan the \"Other resolutions\" for mentions of it. Aha!  Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15 seems promising.  Looking at line 43, it says, word-for-word, that \"Xã Ba Nam\" is being merged into the new \"xã Ba Tô\" along with Ba Lế and Ba Tô. This is a direct hit!\n\nKnowing that \"Xã Ba Nam\" is now part of \"Xã Ba Tô,\" I'll now check my \"New wards\" data.  I'm looking for \"xã Ba Tô\" in that list to confirm its details.  And there it is: I find an entry matching my information with the ward code \"21523,\" the ward name \"Xã Ba Tô,\" and confirming that it's still in \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi.\" This confirms the name and the province is the same as the original.\n\nThis is a very clear-cut case.  The resolution explicitly states the merger of the old ward into the new one. The data matches perfectly.  I'm very confident about this mapping - it's a \"high\" confidence level.\n\nSo, the JSON output I'll provide will include the citation from the resolution, the high confidence level, the correct province name and the new ward details from my \"New wards\" data which is \"21523\" for the `ward_code`, \"Xã Ba Tô\" for the `ward_name`, and also \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\" for the `province_name`.\n",
