  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Tịnh Hòa\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the new administrative unit for the old address \"Xã Tịnh Hòa\", within the province of \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\".  This looks straightforward enough.  The first step, as always, is to pinpoint the relevant resolutions.\n\nMy initial thought is that I need to check the Province Resolutions. It does mention \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\", but it doesn't indicate a name change. However, it does mention a merge, but the name \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\" will be retained.\n\nNext, I'll dive into the resolutions themselves, specifically looking for \"Xã Tịnh Hòa\". Bingo! Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15 provides the key. It clearly states that \"Xã Tịnh Hòa\" is being merged with other units to form the new \"Xã Đông Sơn\".\n\nNow, I'll shift my focus to the list of new wards. I need to find \"Xã Đông Sơn\" with \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\" as its province.  Excellent, there it is! I've also checked whether \"Xã Tịnh Hòa\" itself is listed as an unchanged ward, just in case, but it's not present.\n\nThe resolution also helpfully lists the wards *not* affected by the re-organization, along with an explanation of which wards are formed through merging of other wards. Based on my analysis, those listed as \"not rearranged\" are irrelevant. This tells me that \"Xã Tịnh Hòa\" *has* indeed been merged, as confirmed by the specific resolution.\n\nSo, I'm confident about this answer.  I can construct the JSON output: the citation will be the relevant resolution (1677/NQ-UBTVQH15), the confidence level is high, the province is \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\", the ward code and name come directly from the new wards list entry for \"Xã Đông Sơn\". I will ignore \"Xã Nguyễn Nghiêm\" as one of the new ward options, since it is specifically mentioned as part of a merge to form \"Phường Cẩm Thành\", and should not be a new ward on its own.\n",
