  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Bình Tân Phú\"**\n\nOkay, let's break this down systematically. The user has provided an old address: \"Xã Bình Tân Phú, Huyện Bình Sơn, Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi,\" and I need to figure out the current administrative unit. Given my expertise, I know the first step is to check for province-level mergers. Thankfully, Quảng Ngãi's name remains unchanged.\n\nNext, I need to consult the relevant resolutions, specifically those related to administrative changes within Quảng Ngãi province. Resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15 is key here. Scanning the document, I quickly zeroed in on the section listing ward rearrangements.\n\nInitially, I looked for \"Xã Bình Tân Phú\" and \"Huyện Bình Sơn\" individually. I found that while \"Huyện Bình Sơn\" wasn't explicitly mentioned as being eliminated, my understanding of the problem space, given the context, helped me understand that I needed to focus on ward-level changes. So, I carefully reviewed the list of ward mergers.\n\nI found line 7 lists the merger that created \"Xã Bình Sơn,\" but \"Xã Bình Tân Phú\" was not on that list. Then, in line 9, \"Xã Bình Tân Phú\" was clearly listed among the wards being merged to form the new ward: \"Xã Đông Sơn\"! Eureka!\n\nNow, I double-checked the \"New wards\" list for confirmation, and sure enough, \"Xã Đông Sơn\" was there, along with its corresponding ward code (21109) and the province name, Quảng Ngãi.\n\nTo ensure there were no other relevant mentions of \"Xã Bình Tân Phú,\" I scanned the document again. There were no other mergers that would have resulted in any other new ward for the given information.\n\nFinally, I constructed the output. It will be a JSON structure, clearly indicating that the old \"Xã Bình Tân Phú\" is now part of the new \"Xã Đông Sơn\" (ward code 21109), within \"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi,\" with a \"high\" confidence level because of the direct mapping found in the resolution. The citation will directly quote the relevant section from Resolution 1677. All checks pass, and the output is ready.\n",
