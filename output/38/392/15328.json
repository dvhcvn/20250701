  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Units for \"Xã Hà Bình, Huyện Hà Trung, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\"**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out where \"Xã Hà Bình\" ended up after all the shuffling around.  I know the province, \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa,\" is staying put based on that handy list of provinces exempt from mergers.  That's a good starting point.  Now, the real work begins. I'll need to sift through those resolution documents.\n\nFirst, I quickly dismiss Resolution 1679/NQ-UBTVQH15 because it's about Quảng Ninh, which is definitely not my area of interest today. Now, on to the main event: Resolution 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15 concerning Thanh Hóa. I really need to read this one with a magnifying glass.\n\nImmediately, line 3 jumps out: \"a *part* of 'Xã Hà Bình' is merged into the new 'Xã Hà Trung'.\"  Excellent! That's a direct hit.  But let's not get ahead of ourselves. I scan further and... line 6: the *remaining part* of \"Xã Hà Bình\" is merged into the new \"Xã Hoạt Giang\"!  Bingo! This is promising. No mention of \"Hà Bình\" in line 85, so I move on.\n\nNow, with my two candidates in mind (\"Xã Hà Trung\" and \"Xã Hoạt Giang\"), I need to cross-reference them with the \"New wards\" data.  I'm looking for a precise match on the ward name *and* province.  Ah, here we go! I quickly find the entries for \"Xã Hà Trung\" (ward code 15271) and \"Xã Hoạt Giang\" (ward code 15286), both in \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa.\" Confirmed!\n\nNow, it's just a matter of structuring the output in a clean JSON format. I'll include the province, ward name, ward code, and a \"high\" confidence level because these findings are clear and direct from the resolution text. For the citation, I will include the resolution header and the relevant lines, making sure to highlight the exact portion of the text that confirms the match. This is as solid as it gets.\n",

I need to act as an expert in Vietnamese administrative unit mapping. The user has given me an old address: `Xã Hà Bình, Huyện Hà Trung, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa`. My primary objective is to find the updated administrative unit(s) based on the provided resolutions.\\n\\nFirst, I parsed the input address: \\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\" (ward), \\\"Huyện Hà Trung\\\" (district), and \\\"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\\\" (province). Now, I must analyze the provided resolutions to identify any changes relevant to \\\"Xã Hà Bình.\\\"\\n\\nI began by checking Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW). Fortunately, \\\"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\\\" is listed under \\\"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập,\\\" meaning the province name remains unchanged.\\n\\nNext, I focused on resolutions concerning ward-level changes. Resolution 1679/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Quảng Ninh) was quickly dismissed as irrelevant. However, Resolution 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Thanh Hóa) caught my attention. It was the crucial resolution for this address.\\n\\nCarefully reading the lines of Resolution 1686, I saw that line 3 explicitly mentioned \\\"Xã Hà Bình.\\\"  A portion of \\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\" was merged into a new unit called \\\"Xã Hà Trung.\\\" In line 6, the remaining part of \\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\" merged into \\\"Xã Hoạt Giang\\\".\\n\\nLine 85, was irrelevant. I could ignore this.\\n\\nTo pinpoint the specific new wards, I cross-referenced my findings with the \\\"New wards\\\" list. \\\"Xã Hà Trung\\\" (ward code: 15271) and \\\"Xã Hoạt Giang\\\" (ward code: 15286) in \\\"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\\\" aligned perfectly. The other new wards are irrelevant.\\n\\nTherefore, my conclusion: the former ward \\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\" now consists of portions merged into \\\"Xã Hà Trung\\\" and \\\"Xã Hoạt Giang\\\", both within the district of Huyện Hà Trung, province of Tỉnh Thanh Hóa.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1686/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Thanh Hóa\",\n        \"line\": \"3.

My strategy is straightforward: first, confirm the province, then dig into the resolutions to see how \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been reshaped.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI start by checking the province resolutions (60-NQ/TW), but it's pretty clear that Thanh Hóa hasn't been merged or split.  Good, one less thing to worry about. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thanh Hoá\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is listed as a unit *not* affected by mergers.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to understand what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" itself.  I turn to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specifically 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one dealing with ward arrangements in Thanh Hóa. This is where things get interesting.  Line 3 of the resolution tells me that *part* of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", along with a bunch of other units (Hà Đông, Hà Ngọc, Yến Sơn, and part of the Hà Trung town), was merged to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Then, in line 6, it states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"the remaining part of ... Xã Hà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (after the arrangement in line 3)  was combined with Yên Dương, Hoạt Giang and the remaining part of the Hà Trung town to create \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoạt Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *was* split up. Parts of it went into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the rest went into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoạt Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  I quickly check my list of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to confirm: sure enough, both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoạt Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are present, both listed under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem, though:  the original address only gives me \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a whole.  There's no way to know, based on this information alone, which specific area within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the original address refers to.  Was it the part that's now in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hà Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"?  Or the part that's now in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoạt Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"?  I can't say for certain.  Therefore, I'll have to output *both* as possible matches.  My confidence level for each individual mapping will have to be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", because both are possibilities given the limited information. I will construct my JSON accordingly, providing both as potential results, but highlighting the inherent ambiguity of the mapping.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1686/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Thanh Hóa\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"3.
