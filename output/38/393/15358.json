  "thought": "**Identifying the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this, step-by-step. First, I need to understand that the user is asking about the new administrative unit for \"Xã Vĩnh Tiến, Huyện Vĩnh Lộc, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa.\"  My initial task is to identify this new unit.\n\nMy first step is easy, it's about the province. \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\" seems unchanged, as confirmed by my initial check of resolution 60-NQ/TW, regarding the province-level administrative changes (I quickly checked this to ensure that Thanh Hóa wasn't being merged or split).\n\nNow, the focus shifts to the ward.  I'm looking specifically at \"Xã Vĩnh Tiến.\" I have a feeling I'll find something relevant in the resolutions related to \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa,\" so I search through \"Other Resolutions.\"  Bingo! Resolution 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning the restructuring of communes in Thanh Hóa, is spot-on. I've seen this before, and it's a goldmine for these kinds of queries.\n\nLine 62 of that resolution is the key. It definitively states that \"Xã Vĩnh Tiến,\" along with several other communes, is being combined to form a new ward, \"Xã Tây Đô.\" Perfect!\n\nTo ensure I haven't missed anything, I'm quickly confirming the existence of \"Xã Tây Đô\" in the \"New wards\" list for Thanh Hóa. I see a matching entry, so that's good.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'm briefly looking at other mentions of \"Vĩnh Lộc\" within this same resolution, just to confirm I haven't mixed up any old/new district/ward names. It's crucial not to misinterpret district-level changes with the specific ward the user is asking about. I saw that a *new* \"Xã Vĩnh Lộc\" is created from other old units, but it is *not* related to the merging of \"Xã Vĩnh Tiến.\"\n\nI'm confident in my findings. \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\" remains the province. \"Xã Vĩnh Tiến\" is now part of \"Xã Tây Đô\", with the code \"15361\", according to the resolution. This is a clear-cut case. I have a very high confidence level in this answer, given the direct mapping in the resolution. I'll provide the JSON response based on this.\n",
