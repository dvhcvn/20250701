  "thought": "**Summary of Mapping Process for `Xã Văn Sơn, Huyện Triệu Sơn, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa`**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking about this mapping problem. First, I need to break down the input: `Xã Văn Sơn, Huyện Triệu Sơn, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa`.  I see the ward, district, and province. Then, I check the provided resolutions, starting with the provincial ones.  Since Thanh Hóa isn't on the list for province-level mergers, it stays the same.\n\nNext, I go through each resolution carefully, looking for \"Văn Sơn\" and \"Triệu Sơn\". I eliminate ones from other provinces immediately. The Phú Thọ and Nghệ An resolutions mention \"Văn Sơn,\" but the districts and provinces don't match. Then I hit a potential match with resolution `1686/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Thanh Hóa. I see a `xã Vân Sơn` mentioned.  Aha!  This could be it. It's in the right province, and the surrounding lines in the resolution mention Triệu Sơn district. This is promising, but... the name isn't *exactly* the same. The input is \"Văn Sơn\" and the resolution says \"Vân Sơn\". However, the context is very strong. I check the list of new wards and find \"Xã Tân Ninh, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\" with code \"15715.\" The resolution states `xã Vân Sơn` merged into `xã Tân Ninh`.\n\nHere's where I start to put the pieces together. I recognize that a common error, especially in documents, is typos like that - just a single letter difference. Given the specific context, the district context, and that both spellings actually exist, I'm pretty confident they're referring to the same ward. I check the external web, and that confirmed its existence, which supports the typo assumption.  Therefore, I'm going to map `Xã Văn Sơn, Huyện Triệu Sơn` to `Xã Tân Ninh`.  I'm citing the Thanh Hóa resolution and line 70, highlighting this \"Vân/Văn\" discrepancy. My confidence level, even with that nuance, is high, because the other context (same province, the same district from around the resolution line and that external support) supports the idea. The output is a JSON object confirming this map and is ready to go.\n",

The user's given me a task: translate an old administrative unit, \\\"Xã Văn Sơn, Huyện Triệu Sơn, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa,\\\" to its new counterpart. They've provided resolutions as the source of truth, and I need to output a JSON array following a specified schema.\\n\\nFirst, I'm breaking down the request: the old ward is \\\"Xã Văn Sơn,\\\" in \\\"Huyện Triệu Sơn,\\\" within \\\"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa.\\\" My focus is on the *Other resolutions* since Thanh Hóa province wasn't merged.\\n\\nI start by analyzing the old ward's components.

The user wants me to map an old administrative unit, Xã Văn Sơn in Huyện Triệu Sơn, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa, to its current equivalent based on the provided resolutions.  My initial assessment is to break this down.\\\\n\\\\n**First**, I need to understand the user's request. It's about finding the *new* unit after the old ward, Xã Văn Sơn, was merged. The source of truth here is the `Province resolutions` and `Other resolutions`. The output needs to be a valid JSON array, and the schema is clear. I must identify if the old ward is in these resolutions, find the new wards, provide confidence levels, include citations with headers and lines, and generate a valid JSON.\\\\n\\\\n**Second**, I'll analyze the old ward. It's Xã Văn Sơn, in Huyện Triệu Sơn, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa. I'll remember that as I start looking.\\\\n\\\\n**Third**, I'll start with the *Province Resolutions*. Since the provided resolutions include \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW,\\\\\\\" I'll focus on them first. I can see that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\\\\\\\" is listed as a province not subject to any merges. This checks out with my existing knowledge of the province.\\\\n\\\\n**Fourth**, I'll move on to the `Other resolutions`. I'll scan these for any mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Văn Sơn\\\\\\\", keeping an eye on the province and district names. I'm going through each resolution, noting potential matches. Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 mentions \\\\\\\"Vân Sơn,\\\\\\\" but it's in Bắc Ninh – not a match. I continue through the list, checking Phú Thọ, Nghệ An, and Sơn La. No luck so far. Finally, I have arrived at the key: Resolution 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Thanh Hóa. That is a solid match! I'll dive in now and extract any data that matches.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1686/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Thanh Hóa\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"70.

My first step is to break down the address: ward, district, and province. Then, I need to check for any province mergers first. Thankfully, resolution 60-NQ/TW tells me Thanh Hóa is *not* merged. So, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow comes the hard part: checking the specific resolutions for ward/district changes. I've been given a list of resolutions to scan. I'm focusing on those mentioning Thanh Hóa. I quickly skipped over Bắc Ninh, Phú Thọ, Sơn La... no luck. Then, Nghệ An has a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Văn Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but in a different district.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, I hit 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15, the Thanh Hóa resolution. I'm carefully reading through it. Lines 64 and 67 mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Triệu Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Văn Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Then, I hit line 70, and it says \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Thái Hòa và xã **Vân** Sơn thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tân Ninh**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWait a minute... It's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vân Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the resolution, but the input is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Văn Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"! This is a significant difference. I need to double-check everything. Let me reread the input address... yep, it's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Văn Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". And let me reread the resolution... definitely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vân Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This could be a typo somewhere, a transcription error. I need to clarify this.

I meticulously scan the lines, expecting to find the fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Sơn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere's where it gets interesting. Line 70 mentions a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vân Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" along with thị trấn Nưa and xã Thái Hòa.  However, and this is critical, *it doesn't specify the district*.

The lack of a district specification is a major red flag.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nWhile resolution 1686 clearly describes merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vân Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tân Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *within Thanh Hóa*, the lack of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Triệu Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" alongside it is making me hesitant. I'm trained to be thorough. The other lines specifying the district raise my confidence that it *should* be mentioned.

Specifically, I'm focusing on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1686/NQ-UBTVQH15,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the resolution on administrative rearrangement in Thanh Hóa. I'm scanning through the lines of this resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI quickly found a match in line 70, which discusses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vân Sơn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It's merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Nưa, xã Thái Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, here's where it gets tricky: The *original* address includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Triệu Sơn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but the resolution *doesn't* explicitly state \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"(huyện Triệu Sơn)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" next to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vân Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in that specific line, unlike in lines 64 and 67 where the district is clearly indicated.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis raises a red flag. There are multiple \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Vân Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wards across different provinces in the data. The address is specific to Thanh Hóa, and the resolution *does* mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vân Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being absorbed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The question is, can I definitively say that the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vân Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the address is the same one?
