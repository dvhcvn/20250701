  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this. The user has given me the old address \"Xã Hoằng Xuân, Huyện Hoằng Hóa, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\" and wants the new administrative unit.\n\nFirst, I identified the key parts of the old address. I have \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\" (Thanh Hoa Province) and \"Xã Hoằng Xuân\" (Hoang Xuan Ward).\n\nNext, I checked province resolutions (like 60-NQ/TW) to see if the province name changed. Nope, \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\" is listed as a province that *didn't* merge, so that's easy.\n\nNow, for the tricky part: the ward. I started scanning other resolutions to find any mentions of \"Hoằng Xuân\". Resolution 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Thanh Hoa Province's administrative reorganizations, popped up. Specifically, line 26 caught my eye: it stated that \"Xã Hoằng Xuân\" would merge with several other wards to form the new ward \"Xã Hoằng Giang.\"\n\nMy logic is simple: if the resolution says \"Xã Hoằng Xuân\" becomes part of \"Xã Hoằng Giang,\" then the user's old address points to the new \"Xã Hoằng Giang.\"\n\nTo confirm, I looked up \"Xã Hoằng Giang\" in my list of new wards and found it, with the code \"15880\".\n\nAs an extra check, I scanned the resolution again to make sure there wasn't any other conflicting information about \"Hoằng Xuân\" or \"Hoằng Hóa.\" A separate line (19) does mention \"Hoằng Hóa\", creating a ward from different old wards, but it's clear the address \"Xã Hoằng Xuân\" is part of the \"Xã Hoằng Giang\" merger. So, this analysis holds up.\n\nTherefore, my final output will be: the new province is \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\", the new ward is \"Xã Hoằng Giang\" with the code \"15880,\" and the relevant citation is from resolution 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically line 26. This has high confidence since it is explicitly stated in a relevant resolution.\n",
