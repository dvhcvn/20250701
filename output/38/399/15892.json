  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Hoằng Trung\"**\n\nOkay, let's break this down systematically. The user wants to know the new administrative unit for \"Xã Hoằng Trung, Huyện Hoằng Hóa, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\". As an expert in this, I know the key is understanding how these units have shifted over time.\n\nFirst, I identified the old \"ward\" and \"province\": \"Xã Hoằng Trung\" and \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa,\" respectively. Next, I needed to check if the province had been merged according to the data I have access to. Checking document \"60-NQ/TW,\" I confirmed that \"Tỉnh Thanh Hoá\" is not listed under units that were merged. So, the province name, \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa,\" remains unchanged.\n\nNow, the crucial step: I need to search the relevant resolutions for any mention of \"Hoằng Trung.\" Scanning the lines of each resolution, I honed in on `1686/NQ-UBTVQH15`. I checked it carefully: Line 25 states that \"Xã Hoằng Trung\" is merged into a new unit. I confirmed that with line 19, which does *not* mention \"Hoằng Trung.\" This tells me the relevant data is in line 25.\n\nBased on line 25, \"Xã Hoằng Trung\" is part of the new \"Xã Hoằng Phú\". That's my key finding. Now, I have to match this new name with the \"New wards\" list to obtain the corresponding `ward_code` and other details.\n\nLooking at the list, I locate \"Xã Hoằng Phú.\" It's linked with the code \"15889\" and confirms the `province_name` as \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa.\" Since the match is direct, my confidence in this result is \"high\". I've double checked for the district (\"Huyện Hoằng Hóa\") mentions, but that's irrelevant here.\n\nIn short, \"Xã Hoằng Trung\" is now part of \"Xã Hoằng Phú\" with a code of \"15889\" and falls under \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\". That's a solid finding.\n",
