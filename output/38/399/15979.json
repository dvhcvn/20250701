  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Transformation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \"Xã Hoằng Châu, Huyện Hoằng Hóa, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\" and need to determine its new administrative unit. My initial thought process is to break this down methodically. First, I need to identify the province, which is \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\".  A crucial initial check is whether this province has undergone any mergers or changes.  I found a resolution, specifically \"60-NQ/TW,\" that explicitly states that \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\" remains unchanged. This is good news, as it simplifies the process significantly.\n\nNext, I need to focus on the ward itself, which is \"Xã Hoằng Châu.\" The key here is to find any resolutions related to this specific ward. Digging through the available documents, I landed on \"1686/NQ-UBTVQH15.\" This resolution turned out to be the golden ticket.  Within it, I found a line explicitly mentioning \"Xã Hoằng Châu.\" The resolution states that the existing \"Xã Hoằng Châu,\" along with several other communes (Hoằng Thắng, Hoằng Phong, and Hoằng Lưu), *are all merged into* a new commune, which is also called \"Xã Hoằng Châu\". So, the name stays the same, but the composition and boundaries have changed. A direct transformation!\n\nTo ensure accuracy, I then needed to confirm that this \"new\" \"Xã Hoằng Châu\" exists. I checked my list of 'new wards' and, sure enough, I found an entry:  `{\"ward_code\":\"15976\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Hoằng Châu\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\"}`.  The match is perfect: same name, same province, and a specific code.\n\nMy confidence in this analysis is very high. The province itself is confirmed to be unchanged. The old \"Xã Hoằng Châu\" is explicitly mentioned in the resolution that transforms it into a new unit, which is also named \"Xã Hoằng Châu,\" which is confirmed in the list of 'new wards.'  It's a clear, straightforward administrative restructuring, and this JSON output should be accurate.\n```json\n{\n  \"old_address\": \"Xã Hoằng Châu, Huyện Hoằng Hóa, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\",\n  \"new_address\": \"Xã Hoằng Châu, Huyện Hoằng Hóa, Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\",\n  \"reason\": \"The ward 'Xã Hoằng Châu' was restructured. It was merged with other wards (Hoằng Thắng, Hoằng Phong, Hoằng Lưu) to form a new ward, also named 'Xã Hoằng Châu.' The province remained unchanged, confirmed by resolution 60-NQ/TW. The transformation is confirmed by resolution 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15 and validated by the presence of a new ward with the same name.\",\n  \"confidence\": \"high\",\n  \"details\": {\n    \"province_check\": {\n      \"province\": \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\",\n      \"resolution\": \"60-NQ/TW\",\n      \"result\": \"Unchanged\"\n    },\n    \"ward_resolution\": {\n      \"old_ward\": \"Xã Hoằng Châu\",\n      \"resolution\": \"1686/NQ-UBTVQH15\",\n      \"result\": \"Merged with other wards (Hoằng Thắng, Hoằng Phong, Hoằng Lưu) into a new ward also named 'Xã Hoằng Châu'\"\n    },\n    \"new_ward_check\": {\n      \"new_ward\": \"Xã Hoằng Châu\",\n      \"code\": \"15976\",\n      \"province\": \"Tỉnh Thanh Hóa\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n",
