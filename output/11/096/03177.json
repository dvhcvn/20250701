  "thought": "**Analyzing the Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. I need to figure out the current administrative equivalent of `Xã Huổi Lếnh, Huyện Mường Nhé, Tỉnh Điện Biên` based on the given resolutions and a new wards database.\n\nFirst, I parsed the input. I know I'm dealing with `Xã Huổi Lếnh` (commune), `Huyện Mường Nhé` (district), and `Tỉnh Điện Biên` (province).  I also have Province Resolution 60-NQ/TW and another resolution, 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, plus access to a new wards database.\n\n**Province Resolution 60-NQ/TW:** This resolution deals with province mergers or lack thereof.  Good news, `Tỉnh Điện Biên` is listed as *not* being merged, which aligns with my new wards database. So, the province remains the same.\n\n**Resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15:** This one is specific to `Tỉnh Điện Biên` and, critically, involves re-structuring communes. It states that districts are being eliminated, which means `Huyện Mường Nhé` will no longer exist in its current form.  This is a significant clue.\n\nI drilled down into the resolution. It describes a merger of `Nậm Vì`, `Chung Chải`, and `Mường Nhé` communes into a new commune called `Mường Nhé`.  That's important, but here's the crucial point:  `Xã Huổi Lếnh` is *not* mentioned in this specific section.\n\nSo, I have a problem.  The text suggests a major restructuring within the `Huyện Mường Nhé` district, but it only details one specific merger.  I know that districts are being eliminated, and the prompt implies most wards have been restructured. The absence of information on `Xã Huổi Lếnh` is a glaring gap. Given the context, it's highly likely that `Xã Huổi Lếnh` was also affected by the restructuring. However, the exact new mapping is not present in the provided resolution.  It might have been merged into the new `xã Mường Nhé`, but it is not explicitly stated.\n\nUltimately, based on the provided text, I can't definitively map `Xã Huổi Lếnh` to any new ward. There's not enough data.  While I can infer restructuring, the specific result for `Xã Huổi Lếnh` is unknown. Therefore, I must conclude that I don't have enough information to offer a definite mapping, and the confidence level is low. I will return an empty array to indicate that no suitable match can be derived.\n",

The old address is in Điện Biên province: Xã Huổi Lếnh, Huyện Mường Nhé, Tỉnh Điện Biên. Let's break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look at the province. The 60-NQ/TW resolution confirms that Điện Biên province (Tỉnh Điện Biên) remains unchanged. Good, that's straightforward.\\n\\nNow, let's examine the relevant resolution, 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15.  This deals with the reorganization of administrative units in Điện Biên.  Specifically, it mentions a merger of Nậm Vì, Chung Chải, and Mường Nhé communes into a new commune also called Mường Nhé. That's interesting, and points towards a district-level restructuring.  However, this resolution *doesn't* specifically mention Huổi Lếnh.\\n\\nI also have some data on new wards, and it confirms the existence of the new ward \\\"Xã Mường Nhé\\\" within the province.  This supports the district-level changes.\\n\\nThe challenge now is to map Huổi Lếnh.  The key is that the old district was \\\"Huyện Mường Nhé\\\". The new ward is also called \\\"Xã Mường Nhé\\\". This strongly suggests a major reorganization, likely involving the merger of multiple wards from the old district.  While the text focuses on Nậm Vì, Chung Chải, and Mường Nhé, the fact that the new ward retains the district name implies that other wards, *including* Huổi Lếnh, may have been incorporated.\\n\\nMy conclusion, given the limited information, is that \\\"Xã Mường Nhé\\\" is the most likely new ward.  While I cannot be certain based on the provided text alone, the name similarity and the resolution's overall focus on district-level consolidation make this the most probable mapping.  I'll report this with low confidence, highlighting that further confirmation on Huổi Lếnh's specific inclusion is needed.  The final output will be a JSON object containing the province and the candidate ward, emphasizing the uncertainty.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Điện Biên\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"03160\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Mường Nhé\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh, Huyện Mường Nhé, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 9398,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0032740999999999994,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Address Mapping**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the new administrative location for \\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh, Huyện Mường Nhé, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\".  Let's break this down.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to identify the components of the old address:  \\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Nhé\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\" is the province. Straightforward.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I'm checking the provincial resolution, which is 60-NQ/TW. Good news there – it states that Điện Biên remains unchanged. So, my confidence in the province remaining \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\" is very high.\\\\n\\\\nThe real challenge is the district and ward level changes. I see resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals specifically with *wards* within Điện Biên.  It explicitly merges \\\\\\\"Nậm Vì, Chung Chải, and Mường Nhé\\\\\\\" to form a new \\\\\\\"xã Mường Nhé.\\\\\\\"  Crucially, my input, \\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh,\\\\\\\" isn't *mentioned* in this resolution.  However, this resolution *does* eliminate districts.\\\\n\\\\nI have a new ward dataset. It shows that \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Nhé\\\\\\\" (code 03160) exists, confirmed by resolution 1661. This is important. But remember, the resolution specifies that \\\\\\\"Nậm Vì, Chung Chải, and Mường Nhé\\\\\\\" are merged into the new \\\\\\\"xã Mường Nhé\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe prompt highlights that many wards have been renamed, split, or merged. This tells me I need to be diligent about changes.  Because the district level is eliminated, \\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Nhé\\\\\\\" is no longer valid. However, since the resolution doesn't mention \\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh,\\\\\\\" and I have insufficient data on its re-location, I cannot definitively map it.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, while I can confirm that the province is unchanged and I have found the new \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Nhé\\\\\\\" created by merging certain wards, I can't definitively determine the current administrative location of \\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh\\\\\\\" because it is *not* addressed in the provided resolution or data. More information about the fate of \\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh\\\\\\\" is needed for a reliable mapping.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập:\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"4.

The goal is to figure out the new administrative location of an old address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh, Huyện Mường Nhé, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  First things first, I need to break down the old address into its components: ward, district, and province.  Easy enough: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Nhé\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the real work begins.  I'm armed with resolution data, so let's see what it says.  Province first. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Điện Biên remains unchanged.  That gives me solid confidence in that aspect.  Now the tricky part: the district and ward. I have resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, and this is where it gets interesting.  It's focused on ward-level changes within Điện Biên.  It explicitly merges \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Nậm Vì, Chung Chải, and Mường Nhé\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into a *new* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Nhé\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, my target ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't mentioned. That's a red flag. The resolution centers on specific *xã* merges. The initial instruction that districts are eliminated adds another layer of complexity.  I do have data that shows \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Nhé\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as a new ward, but the resolution doesn't definitively tell me what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huổi Lếnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The resolution focuses on a specific merging of *xã* names; Huổi Lếnh is not included in the merges, but the fact that districts are eliminated does mean that Huyện Mường Nhé is gone.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven that the task is about mapping an old address to a *new* administrative unit, and the user provided information about districts being eliminated, I have to conclude that mapping the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *specifically* is impossible.  There's no definitive information in the provided data to point me to a new ward for the old address.  It's likely that Huổi Lếnh exists in a new location, but I don't have enough data to say for sure where. My current conclusions do suggest the probability of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Nhé\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" no longer existing, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Nhé\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" becoming a new ward; however, there is not adequate information to determine the current location of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Huổi Lếnh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập:\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"4.
