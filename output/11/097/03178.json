  "thought": "**Processing the User's Request**\n\nOkay, so I need to find the new administrative unit for \"Xã Xá Tổng, Huyện Mường Chà, Tỉnh Điện Biên.\" First, let's break this down: I know I'm looking for the updated ward information for that specific location within Điện Biên province.\n\nBased on my knowledge, I'll first check if Điện Biên was affected by any province-level mergers. The list of provinces not undergoing mergers confirms that Điện Biên province remains unchanged. That part is straightforward.\n\nNow, I'm going to delve into the relevant resolutions regarding administrative changes within Điện Biên. I found 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically addressing \"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Điện Biên.\" This looks promising! My approach will be methodical: I'll review each line within this resolution and see if it mentions \"Xã Xá Tổng.\"\n\nI went through each line, and sadly, no dice. There's no mention of \"Xã Xá Tổng\" anywhere in this resolution. It does describe the merging of other wards to create new ones like \"xã Mường Chà\" and \"xã Na Sang,\" but our target ward isn't listed as a contributing element.\n\nGiven that I have only the specified text, I'm at a bit of an impasse.  The provided resolutions are very specific about the included units.  Since \"Xã Xá Tổng\" isn't explicitly mentioned as part of any new ward, I can't definitively map it to a new unit. There are a few possibilities, but all based on assumptions. It could be unchanged, merged into another unit not mentioned here, or a differently named unit altogether.\n\nConsidering the user's instructions and my knowledge base, I must conclude that the available information is insufficient to confidently determine the new administrative unit.  Therefore, and considering the given instructions, an empty array is the correct answer. I cannot speculate or make assumptions beyond the text that the user provided. The database does not contain the required information.\n",

My task is to find the new administrative unit corresponding to the old \\\"Xã Xá Tổng, Huyện Mường Chà, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\". I'm starting by establishing the key pieces: \\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\" (the ward), \\\"Huyện Mường Chà\\\" (the district), and \\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\" (the province).\\n\\nFirst, I confirm that \\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\" is one of the provinces *not* undergoing merger, as confirmed by Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This means the province name remains unchanged. Excellent.\\n\\nNow, the crucial step: I need to scrutinize the resolutions provided, focusing on any mentions of \\\"Xã Xá Tổng,\\\" \\\"Huyện Mường Chà,\\\" or \\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên.\\\" I methodically go through the list: 1657/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Cao Bằng) - irrelevant. 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Điện Biên) - definitely relevant. I need to be precise here.\\n\\nScanning 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, I don't see any explicit mention of \\\"Xã Xá Tổng.\\\" However, I do find lines like the creation of \\\"xã Mường Chà\\\" (from Chà Cang, Chà Nưa, Nậm Tin, and Pa Tần) and \\\"xã Na Sang\\\" (from thị trấn Mường Chà, Ma Thì Hồ, Sa Lông, and Na Sang). These other wards are renamed or merged and I can see what became of them. I continue to check Resolutions 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Hưng Yên), 1681/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Sơn La), and 1686/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Thanh Hóa) - all irrelevant.\\n\\nSo, the issue is clear. \\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\" isn't explicitly addressed in *any* of the resolutions I have. And according to the prompt, the Vietnamese government eliminated all districts. I am going to have to conclude that because \\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\" wasn't mentioned in a merger/renaming, it is either *unchanged* or *merged* in a way that wasn't included in the available source material. Since the provided text is the only truth I have to work with, it does not state anything about this specific case and I cannot make any assumptions. I can't definitively determine its current administrative status with the information at hand. There is no mapping I can make based on the given evidence. I'm left with the details of how \\\"xã Mường Chà\\\" and \\\"xã Na Sang\\\" were created, but that doesn't help me with \\\"Xã Xá Tổng.\\\"\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Điện Biên\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Xá Tổng, Huyện Mường Chà, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 15268,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0031385000000000002,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change Request**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng, Huyện Mường Chà, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\". Let's break this down systematically.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the key information: the ward \\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng,\\\\\\\" the district \\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Chà,\\\\\\\" and the province \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên.\\\\\\\"  Next, I had to consult the provided resolutions, starting with Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which lists provinces involved in administrative restructuring.  Thankfully, Điện Biên is *not* listed as undergoing provincial-level merger, so the province itself remains unchanged.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I shifted focus to finding any resolutions impacting wards and districts within Điện Biên. Resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically regarding \\\\\\\"sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Điện Biên,\\\\\\\" caught my eye. Within this resolution, I scanned the lines carefully.  I noticed the creation of two new wards: \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chà\\\\\\\" (from several wards in both Huyện Mường Chà and Huyện Nậm Pồ) and \\\\\\\"Xã Na Sang\\\\\\\" (from the Thị trấn Mường Chà and the wards Ma Thì Hồ, Sa Lông, Na Sang). Neither of these new wards includes \\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\" in their composition, based on the text provided.  The other resolutions provided are irrelevant, targeting different provinces.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, judging solely from the information I have at hand, I can't definitively determine the fate of \\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng.\\\\\\\" It wasn't explicitly mentioned in any of the relevant restructuring plans, at least in this provided material. It might have become a part of a new unit not explicitly outlined in these particular documents, or it may be that it kept its name.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, I checked the list of \\\\\\\"new wards\\\\\\\" to see if there was a direct match. There are \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chà\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Na Sang\\\\\\\" in Tỉnh Điện Biên, created by resolution 1661. \\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\" is not listed as a component of either. To find the answer, I will need to consult external sources.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng, Huyện Mường Chà, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 16553,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.003741,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Processing Administrative Restructuring for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng, Huyện Mường Chà, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, let's break this down. My task is to determine the updated administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Chà,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Điện Biên Province. I'll need to carefully analyze the provided resolutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I note that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't listed for any provincial-level mergers according to the relevant resolution.  So, the province name remains the same.  That's straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I shift focus to the ward and district levels.  My key source will be the Điện Biên resolution, `1661/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  While I *don't* see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" explicitly mentioned, I *do* see a significant restructuring within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Chà.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Several wards *are* merging into two new units, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Na Sang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Importantly, the user mentioned *all* districts were being eliminated. This means \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Chà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" no longer exists as a district.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis changes everything. Because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Chà,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I have to consider it was affected by the district's elimination and restructuring.  But, the problem is, the resolution does *not* specify what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It doesn't appear as a component of either new ward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLet's check the lists of the new wards.  I have two candidates, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Na Sang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, I am not able to confirm, from the resolution text, if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was added to either of these new wards, or if it has been renamed, or if it is now under a different arrangement that isn't included in the current analysis. It's a key missing piece of information.  I require additional sources to determine the updated administrative structure of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My current data is insufficient to definitively answer the user's request.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"03166\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chà\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"03172\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Na Sang\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng, Huyện Mường Chà, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8086,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0036085,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Analysis of Address and Resolution Mapping**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng, Huyện Mường Chà, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to determine its corresponding new administrative unit. First, I break down the address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mường Chà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the province. Straight away, I see that the province, Điện Biên, is listed as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"không thực hiện sáp nhập,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" meaning it remains unchanged.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI move on to the resolutions, specifically looking for those related to Điện Biên. I find \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1661/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Điện Biên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This resolution details changes within Điện Biên.  I read through the resolution, noting the specific wards and towns mentioned in the merging process. I carefully look for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but it's *not* explicitly mentioned in any of the lines describing the new wards or merging processes.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then check the provided list of new wards, filtering for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I see two new wards: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Na Sang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, neither resolution mentions merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into either of these. The resolutions describe the formation of these new wards from other, specific old wards.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSince \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't listed as being merged into a new ward, and it's not listed as a new ward itself, I can't confidently determine its new status. It might have been incorporated into one of the new wards in a way not detailed in the provided information, it might have been kept unchanged, or merged into something else entirely. The prompt suggests a low confidence level if there isn't enough information, and the fact that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't listed at all is enough to indicate that I can't identify a new corresponding ward. So, based on the provided data, I must mark the confidence as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and conclude that I cannot determine the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with the given information.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1661/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"7.

First, I have to analyze the components: ward, district, and province. The province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged as per Resolution 60-NQ/TW.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then move on to the other resolutions, specifically those concerning Điện Biên. Resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15 catches my eye. It details some ward reorganizations, specifically mentioning the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Na Sang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from other wards. However, the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in any of these lines.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI also checked the list of new wards for Điện Biên. I found \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mường Chà\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Na Sang,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but neither aligns directly with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The key is that the resolutions specify *which* old wards are being combined to form the new ones. It doesn't give a general rule on how all wards of a district were affected.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xá Tổng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is not listed as being *merged* into a new ward, and it's not listed as a new ward itself, I can't confidently map it. The information is insufficient to provide a definitive answer. The ward might have been kept unchanged, merged into one of the new wards not mentioned, or merged with something not covered by the available data. My confidence here is low. Since I can't find a direct mapping, I have to state that I'm unable to determine its status.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1661/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"7.
