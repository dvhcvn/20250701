  "thought": "**My Analysis of \"Xã Xín Chải, Huyện Tủa Chùa, Tỉnh Điện Biên\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old ward \"Xã Xín Chải, Huyện Tủa Chùa, Tỉnh Điện Biên\" and need to find its new administrative unit. My initial steps involve clarifying the province, which remains \"Tỉnh Điện Biên\" as per Resolution 60-NQ/TW.\n\nI then dive into relevant resolutions. I focused on Resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns \"tỉnh Điện Biên.\" While it does mention \"Huyện Tủa Chùa\" and forms a new \"Xã Tủa Chùa,\" it unfortunately doesn't include \"Xã Xín Chải\" in the list of merged wards. That's a dead end, at least for now.\n\nThen, there's Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, a resolution for \"tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\" Now, this piqued my interest because it *does* mention a \"Xã Xín Chải\" being merged into a new \"Xã Lao Chải.\" However, a critical problem emerges: the province in the resolution is Tuyên Quang, not Điện Biên. The data confirms the new \"Xã Lao Chải\" is indeed in Tuyên Quang. This strongly suggests this \"Xã Xín Chải\" is a different entity.\n\nReviewing the data, the old ward \"Xã Xín Chải\" in \"Tỉnh Điện Biên\" doesn't have a clear match.\n\nBased on the information available, the only potential candidate is \"Xã Lao Chải, Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\" as a product of Resolution 1684. This is purely from a name match and should be reported with *low* confidence, given the crucial province mismatch. A high probability exists that the user mistakenly provided the province.\n\nHere's my final reasoning and the details I'll report in my conclusion: the \"Xã Lao Chải\" found in the Tuyen Quang resolution is the only candidate, as it is the only match from the resolution data. I found it in Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 71, which reads \"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Xín Chải, Thanh Đức và Lao Chải thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Lao Chải.\" The new ward has these details: `{\"ward_code\":\"00937\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Lao Chải\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\"}`. My confidence in this association is low due to the province error, or lack of input details. There appears to be insufficient data to resolve this to the higher expert level, so my response will reflect that uncertainty.\n",

My initial focus is on the province, Điện Biên, and how it was affected by any mergers.  The good news is, based on document 60-NQ/TW, Điện Biên wasn't merged.  So, at least that part of the old structure remains.\\n\\nNext, I need to dive into those other resolutions, focusing on ward-level changes within Điện Biên, and specifically, anything concerning \\\"Xã Xín Chải.\\\" I see a mention of \\\"Tủa Chùa\\\" in resolution 1661, but it describes the merger of the *thị trấn Tủa Chùa*, not `Xã Xín Chải` itself. This is a bit of a red herring, but it highlights the need for careful contextual analysis – the presence of \\\"Tủa Chùa\\\" is suggestive, but not definitive.\\n\\nThen there's that other resolution, 1684, where I spotted this line, *\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Xín Chải, Thanh Đức và Lao Chải thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Lao Chải**.\\\"* That jumps out because it *does* mention \\\"Xã Xín Chải\\\"! However, the resolution is for Tuyên Quang province, not Điện Biên! That's a huge conflict. This means I'm likely dealing with two distinct wards with the same name.\\n\\nTo confirm this, I need to check the list of new wards. Sure enough, there's an \\\"Xã Lao Chải\\\" in Tuyên Quang. Given the conflicting provinces, and that my input ward is specifically in Điện Biên, this leads me to conclude that resolution 1684 is describing a *different* \\\"Xã Xín Chải\\\" entirely.\\n\\nUltimately, I haven't found a direct match for the input ward within the resolutions provided.  The original \\\"Xã Xín Chải, Huyện Tủa Chùa, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\" appears to have not been directly merged based on the documents I have. My analysis needs further refinement or the inclusion of more data, since this appears to be the most appropriate conclusion at this time.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Điện Biên\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Xín Chải, Huyện Tủa Chùa, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 16801,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0032021,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Initial Assessment: Navigating the Ward Mapping Quandary**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I've got this request to map an old administrative unit, specifically `Xã Xín Chải, Huyện Tủa Chùa, Tỉnh Điện Biên`, to its current counterpart. The input includes province resolutions, other resolutions, and a list of new wards.  My first task is to break down this request and ensure I understand the context.\\\\n\\\\nMy initial analysis confirms the ward name (`Xã Xín Chải`), district (`Huyện Tủa Chùa`), and province (`Tỉnh Điện Biên`).  Straightforward enough. Now, I have to dive into the resolutions, starting with the provincial ones.\\\\n\\\\n**Province Level Analysis: A Non-Merger Confirmation**\\\\n\\\\nThe good news is that `Tỉnh Điện Biên` doesn't seem to have undergone a provincial merger, according to resolution `60-NQ/TW`. That simplifies things at the top level. The province has remained the same, `Tỉnh Điện Biên`.  That's a point of clarification I can now confidently make.\\\\n\\\\n**Ward-Level Resolutions: Where Things Get Complicated**\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to meticulously scrutinize the other resolutions for mentions of `Xã Xín Chải`.  The first one, `1661/NQ-UBTVQH15`, discusses re-arrangements within `Tỉnh Điện Biên`. I identified that it does include a key reference to the district in question, as it mentions `thị trấn Tủa Chùa`, which is closely related to `Huyện Tủa Chùa` of the input.  However, this resolution *doesn't* contain a direct reference to my target ward, `Xã Xín Chải`.  A closer reading of the full resolution might be required, but at this stage, based on the provided snippet, it's not a direct match.\\\\n\\\\nThe second resolution, `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`, is for `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`.  Initially, it seems irrelevant. However, a specific line *does* mention `Xã Xín Chải`! It describes a merger of `Xín Chải`, `Thanh Đức`, and `Lao Chải` to form a new ward, `Lao Chải`. The problem? The new ward is within `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`.  This creates a significant geographical conflict.\\\\n\\\\n**Synthesizing and Evaluating: The Mapping Dilemma**\\\\n\\\\nThe `New wards` list confirms the existence of `Xã Lao Chải` in `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`, as stated in resolution `1684/NQ-UBTVQH15`. The pieces are all here, but they don't quite fit.  I have a direct match on the ward name `Xã Xín Chải` in a resolution, indicating that the old `Xã Xín Chải` is *now* `Xã Lao Chải`. The issue is, this new ward is in `Tỉnh Tuyên Quang`, not `Tỉnh Điện Biên`, where the original ward is located.\\\\n\\\\nI'm facing a serious potential scenario of either a data error in the input or a geographical conflict, as I consider that it's highly improbable to have the same named ward with different districts and provinces. I'm going to have to make further clarifications here. It appears that one of the following scenarios must be true:\\\\n\\\\n1.  There are two separate wards named \\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải,\\\\\\\" one in Điện Biên and one in Tuyên Quang. The provided resolution maps the Tuyên Quang ward.\\\\n2.  There is a serious data discrepancy, either in the original ward location or in the resolution information.\\\\n\\\\nI need to flag this potential conflict and either seek clarification about the data sources, or suggest a further investigation of this scenario.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"00937\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Lao Chải\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"03217\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Tủa Chùa\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải, Huyện Tủa Chùa, Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 17501,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0036121,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Processing the Administrative Unit Update**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, let's break down this request. I need to figure out what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải, Huyện Tủa Chùa, Tỉnh Điện Biên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" First, I'm analyzing the address. We've got a ward, a district, and a province.  Then, I'm checking the province status. The initial check of Resolution 60-NQ/TW shows that Điện Biên isn't listed for any provincial mergers. So the province itself is unchanged.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I'm diving into other resolutions. Resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Điện Biên province, caught my attention. It details the creation of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tủa Chùa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which is within the correct district, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tủa Chùa.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, it doesn't mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" A different resolution, 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, also mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but this is for Tuyên Quang, not Điện Biên. The Tuyên Quang resolution merges a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lao Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". That's a strong lead, but the province name is wrong!\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI cross-referenced this with my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"new wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.  There's a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lao Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Tuyên Quang (from Resolution 1684) and a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Điện Biên (from Resolution 1661). \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Điện Biên is the stronger candidate because it's in the correct province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, here's the tricky part. The Tuyên Quang \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lao Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data is interesting because it *does* involve a merging of a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which suggests a possible merger. Because the province names don't match, this data suggests two possibilities, depending on if the user input data is incorrect, or if there is a conflict. Resolution 1661 suggests that the district has been altered, and this must be investigated. It's plausible that a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" existed in both provinces.  For the district-level changes, my primary candidates are \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The user must be informed of the conflict in possible addresses, and should be provided the possible data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1684/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"71.

My task is to map this old Vietnamese address – Xã Xín Chải, Huyện Tủa Chùa, Tỉnh Điện Biên – to its current administrative equivalents, given the provided resolutions and new ward data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the components: Xã Xín Chải (ward), Huyện Tủa Chùa (district), and Tỉnh Điện Biên (province). Knowing my way around these regulations, I started by checking the crucial Resolution 60-NQ/TW.  Good, Điện Biên is not undergoing any province-level mergers, so Tỉnh Điện Biên remains unchanged.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I dove into other resolutions, meticulously scanning for any mentions of Xín Chải, Tủa Chùa, or Điện Biên.  Here's where it got interesting. Resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Điện Biên, outlined the merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Tủa Chùa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Mường Báng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nà Tòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". While \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is in the old address, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't specifically part of that merger. I need to keep that in mind.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, there was Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, but it's for Tuyên Quang and mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  However, that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is in Tuyên Quang, *not* Điện Biên, so it's irrelevant to my current address.  I'll dismiss that one.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, checking the new ward data, I found these options:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"00937\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lao Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}` -  A match for Resolution 1684, but again, Tuyên Quang is off the table here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"03217\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}` - Aha! This matches the new ward outlined in Resolution 1661, related to the Điện Biên province.  The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is clearly a valid new ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe problem is, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* mentioned in this specific merger. The information suggests it's within the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" administrative unit, but not included with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Tủa Chùa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Mường Báng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Nà Tòng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This means that the Xã Xín Chải likely remains an independent unit within the district, but the name is not reflected on the changes.

Ah, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Điện Biên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is listed under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" meaning Điện Biên remains unchanged at the province level. That's a good start.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I'll delve into the other resolutions.  My initial focus is on anything mentioning \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tủa Chùa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Điện Biên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Resolution 1661/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Điện Biên, catches my eye. It creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" by merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Tủa Chùa, xã Mường Báng và xã Nà Tòng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  While \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is in the old address, and the resolution *is* about Điện Biên, the crucial point is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't mentioned in this specific merger. It seems \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" might be the district center but the *commune*-level unit is created. My gut says this resolution won't apply to the *commune*-level \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15. Bingo!  It talks about merging \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải, Thanh Đức, and Lao Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lao Chải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" But wait... this is for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tuyên Quang,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *not* Điện Biên! I need to be careful; while it uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" it's a different \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This one is in Tuyên Quang. Clearly, this isn't relevant to my task.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTime to check the new ward data. I see a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lao Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Tuyên Quang - confirms my previous assessment. That's a no-go.  Then, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Điện Biên... this matches with Resolution 1661! Ah, but does it apply to *this* specific \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xín Chải?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The resolution is about a *different* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tủa Chùa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the new name for the merged entity). So, based on my analysis of the available resolutions and the fact that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xín Chải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't part of any of the described mergers, I believe I do not have enough information to accurately map this address to a new ward.
