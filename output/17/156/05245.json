  "thought": "**Identifying the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Săm Khóe\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My objective is to pinpoint the new administrative unit for the old ward \"Xã Săm Khóe\" located in \"Huyện Mai Châu, Tỉnh Hoà Bình.\" The first step, naturally, is analyzing the given information. We know we're dealing with \"Xã Săm Khóe,\" \"Huyện Mai Châu,\" and \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" – easy enough.\n\nNext, I need to consult the relevant resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW is key, and it confirms my initial hunch: \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" has been merged and now falls under the umbrella of \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" So, the new province for \"Xã Săm Khóe\" is definitely \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"\n\nResolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 provides more detail on administrative adjustments specifically within \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" I zero in on \"Huyện Mai Châu\" and scrutinize the text. I see that the resolution outlines the formation of \"Xã Mai Châu\" and \"Xã Tân Mai\" through the consolidation of other units in the area, but crucial missing information is whether \"Xã Săm Khóe\" is explicitly merged into them. Unfortunately, \"Xã Săm Khóe\" is *not* mentioned in this resolution.\n\nLooking at the proposed new wards, the candidate list presents \"Xã Mai Châu\" and \"Xã Tân Mai\" as plausible choices, both created from components within the old \"Huyện Mai Châu.\" However, since \"Xã Săm Khóe\" is not *explicitly* referenced, I cannot be 100% sure about which of the new wards it now belongs to. \"Xã Thanh Sơn,\" while geographically near, is not relevant to the provided resolutions.\n\nConsidering all this, I'm leaning towards \"Xã Mai Châu\" and \"Xã Tân Mai\" as the *most likely* possibilities, but the confidence is low. Based on the resolution and the merging of units, it's highly plausible that \"Xã Săm Khóe\" was absorbed into one of the newly formed wards in the same geographical area. So, I will proceed by stating my findings as such, providing the data structure as you requested.\n\nThe data will be presented as an array containing JSON objects. Each object will feature `province_name`, `ward_name`, `ward_code` and `confidence`. Since \"Xã Săm Khóe\" isn't explicitly mentioned, I cannot cite any specific lines. Both will be classified as low-confidence.\n",

My approach involved a methodical examination of available data and resolutions.\\n\\nFirst, I established the basic parameters: the old ward, district, and province.  Recognizing that province mergers have occurred, I immediately consulted the key resolution (60-NQ/TW).  This confirmed that \\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\" is no longer a distinct entity, having merged with \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\" This shifted my focus to \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\" as the target province.\\n\\nNext, I delved into resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, a key document pertaining to administrative restructuring within Phú Thọ.  After a thorough line-by-line scan, I identified restructuring efforts concerning several communes within the old \\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\" such as thị trấn Mai Châu, xã Nà Phòn, Thành Sơn, Tòng Đậu, Đồng Tân, and Sơn Thủy. Notably, this resolution establishes \\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\" and \\\"Xã Tân Mai.\\\" However, \\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\" did *not* appear in any of the lines provided.\\n\\nConsidering the fact that \\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\" no longer exists and is now part of \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\\\" I can deduce that \\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\" must fall within the new Phú Thọ province. The provided context reveals a re-organization of several communes, but it lacks definitive information about \\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\".  Because \\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\" is dissolved, I suspect that \\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\" may have been merged into one of the newly created communes, such as \\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\" or \\\"Xã Tân Mai\\\", or into an unmentioned one.\\n\\nI identified the following relevant wards created from the communes in old \\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\": \\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\" and \\\"Xã Tân Mai\\\". Although I have clear evidence that the old ward is now a part of \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\" since Hoà Bình is merged into it, and there is restructuring in that old district with two new communes created, I currently lack direct evidence to definitively link \\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\" to a specific new ward based on the information I have.  Further research may be needed to locate the precise mapping of \\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\" within this evolving administrative landscape.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Săm Khóe, Huyện Mai Châu, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 17321,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0030937,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Navigating Vietnamese Administrative Restructuring**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, I'm diving into this. My task is to pinpoint the current administrative location of the old ward \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\" within the shifting landscape of Vietnamese administrative units. I'll need to use my expertise in this domain to deduce the new designation.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I've got to analyze the input: \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\\\\\" in the former \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\\\\\".  The initial step is always to trace provincial changes, so I'll check Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Ah, there it is – the merger of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\\\\\" with \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\" to form a new \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\".  This implies that \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\" is now part of Phú Thọ.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I'll need to look at specific resolutions regarding ward/district-level changes. The key document here is Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Phú Thọ.  I'll carefully review the resolution to see if \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\" is directly mentioned, hoping for a clear answer.  Scrolling through, I see mentions of \\\\\\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\\\\\" communes like thị trấn Mai Châu, Nà Phòn, Thành Sơn, Tòng Đậu, Đồng Tân, and Sơn Thủy.  However, \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\" isn't listed.  This is a snag.\\\\n\\\\nThe resolution provides details on new communes created in the old \\\\\\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\\\\\", such as \\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Mai\\\\\\\". These are significant because they seem to be formed from other communes *within the same old district* as \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\".  My thought is that \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\" *must* have been absorbed into one of these newly formed entities, or perhaps a different one.  I'm missing a piece of the puzzle here: the provided resolutions are excerpts, not complete texts. I suspect that further rearrangement details for \\\\\\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\\\\\" exist outside of what's provided.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the existing information,  I have no direct link between \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\" and a specific new ward. Nevertheless, I'm confident that the new ward is in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\" because the old \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\\\\\" is now part of Phú Thọ. Considering the creation of wards from existing communes in the old \\\\\\\"Huyện Mai Châu\\\\\\\", it's *highly probable* that \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\" is part of the newly formed \\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Mai\\\\\\\", or another newly formed ward not included in the provided snippets. The current information, which indicates that districts have been eliminated, and communes rearranged, makes it clear that the old ward no longer exists in its previous configuration.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe, Huyện Mai Châu, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 16514,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0034936999999999998,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**My Thought Process: Mapping a Vietnamese Address**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tasked with mapping an old Vietnamese address, specifically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe, Huyện Mai Châu, Tỉnh Hoà Bình,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to its new administrative unit(s). I need to be thorough and precise, leveraging the provided resolutions and database.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Phase 1: Understanding the Task**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I break down the request. I have the old address, a task (find the new ward), and crucial information: province-level and ward-level resolutions, a new wards database, the required output format (JSON), and the need to assess mapping confidence and cite sources.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Phase 2: Deep Dive into the Resolutions**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI start with the province-level resolution (60-NQ/TW) to see if Hòa Bình changed. Aha! Line 4 indicates Hòa Bình merged into Phú Thọ. So, any mapping will ultimately point to Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the ward-level resolution (1676/NQ-UBTVQH15) for Phú Thọ. This is key. I'm searching for mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 119 creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from a part of the old district. Line 123 forms \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Mai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in a similar way. Notably, neither mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" directly.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Phase 3: Synthesis and Output**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Săm Khóe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't specified, I cannot be certain of the new ward(s). However, considering the context of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the new wards \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tân Mai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are *potential* candidates. I should flag this uncertainty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBecause the source text only includes snippets of the larger resolutions, it is incomplete. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Săm Khóe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" may have been absorbed into one of the newly created units or something else entirely.

Let's break this down systematically.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, the old province is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The resolution (60-NQ/TW) clearly states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged, becoming part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This simplifies the province identification.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, focusing on the specific locality: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe, Huyện Mai Châu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  My task here is to determine which new wards these old units have become.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then check resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, a resolution specific to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" consistent with the province merger.  I search within this resolution for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Săm Khóe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mai Châu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Line 119 describes a rearrangement that includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and various other wards that are reconfigured into the new ward, **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**  Crucially, Line 123 details the creation of **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Mai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't appear explicitly in this resolution.  Therefore, I'll need to interpret the resolution in conjunction with the list of new wards to see how this is applied.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nAnalyzing the new wards list, I see:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"** in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" potentially aligning with the old district and surrounding entities from the resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Mai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"** in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" also directly derived from resolution 123.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thanh Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"** in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This presents a bit of a wrinkle. Resolution 119 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being *merged* into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The list shows a separate \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thanh Sơn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" raising questions about a potential name conflict.  After closer examination of Resolution 119, it's clear the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is indeed part of the newly formed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It appears the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thanh Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" listed might be a separate and unrelated entity within the province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, considering the information from the resolutions and the provided new ward data, my current assessment is that the old address is now likely to be part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Mai.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, I must clarify that further research might be required to definitively confirm the exact new ward for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Further investigation of the relationship between \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thanh Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" would be prudent, just to have a complete and comprehensive analysis.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc, tỉnh Phú Thọ và tỉnh Hoà Bình; lấy tên là tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"05200\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1676/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"119.

First, I identify the province as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Based on resolution 60-NQ/TW, this province has been absorbed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This sets the stage. Now, I need to pinpoint the specific district and ward within this new context.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe old ward is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the district \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Mai Châu.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  My next step involves examining resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key document detailing the relevant adjustments within Phú Thọ.  While this resolution confirms Phú Thọ's jurisdiction, it doesn't explicitly mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Săm Khóe.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, I find that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and multiple wards of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" district are reorganized. Specifically, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" becomes part of the new ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (line 119). Similarly, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sơn Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is combined with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tân Thành\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to create \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Mai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (line 123).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I cross-reference this with the list of new wards provided. I find \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Mai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" both listed under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which aligns with my understanding from the resolution.

Resolution 119 stated that Thành Sơn became part of Xã Mai Châu. Given this context, I suspect this is a distinct ward called Xã Thanh Sơn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, the likely candidates for the new location of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Săm Khóe, Huyện Mai Châu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are: *either merged into or directly replaced by Xã Mai Châu.*, and potentially also Xã Tân Mai.
