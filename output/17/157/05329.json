  "thought": "**Identifying the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user's looking for the updated administrative unit for \"Xã Ngọc Sơn, Huyện Lạc Sơn, Tỉnh Hoà Bình.\" My initial thought is to tackle this systematically.\n\nFirst, I need to focus on the province, \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình.\" Checking for province-level changes, I know from Resolution 60-NQ/TW that Hòa Bình was, in fact, merged. It became part of Phú Thọ.\n\nNow that the province is solidified, let's turn to \"Xã Ngọc Sơn, Huyện Lạc Sơn.\" My goal is to find where this old ward fits into the new structure of \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" My instinct is to scan resolutions related to administrative rearrangements, specifically looking for mentions of \"Ngọc Sơn\" and \"Lạc Sơn\" within the context of the new province name, Phú Thọ.\n\nResolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Phú Thọ, immediately catches my eye. Line 108 is particularly promising. It states that \"Ngọc Lâu,\" \"Tự Do,\" and \"Ngọc Sơn\" were combined into a new \"Xã Ngọc Sơn.\" The similarity between this new name and the old address is incredibly significant. The only question now is to confirm that this is the Ngọc Sơn we're looking for, rather than a different Ngọc Sơn in Vietnam.\n\nTo eliminate ambiguity, I needed to check *all* of the resolutions to see if there was another Ngọc Sơn elsewhere, as there may be other administrative units that share the same name. After carefully examining the resolutions for other provinces, I confirmed that none of the other instances of Ngọc Sơn were related to our original location in Hòa Bình.\n\nBased on this, it's highly likely that the \"Ngọc Sơn\" in the Phú Thọ resolution is the one from the old Hòa Bình. Therefore, my conclusion is that \"Xã Ngọc Sơn, Huyện Lạc Sơn, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" is now located in the new \"Xã Ngọc Sơn\" under \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" It's a combination of the old villages, with the same name.\n",
