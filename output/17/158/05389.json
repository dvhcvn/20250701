  "thought": "**Address Mapping Analysis for Vietnamese Administrative Units**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this address mapping task. The goal is to accurately translate an old Vietnamese address to the updated administrative structure, given some resolutions and new ward data.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the input address. It looks like we're dealing with \"Xã Ngọc Lương\" in \"Huyện Yên Thủy\", which is part of \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\".  My initial thought is to tackle this hierarchically, starting with the highest level.\n\nThe first point of focus is the provincial level changes. The resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW, are going to be key here.  I'm looking closely at how \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" is impacted. Ah, here we go!  Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Hòa Bình merges into Phú Thọ.  So, the province name needs to change to \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  That seems pretty decisive.\n\nNow, I'll dive into the lower-level details.  I'm searching for mentions of \"Xã Ngọc Lương\" within the other resolutions, because I need to see what happened to it at the ward level.  Bingo! Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, Line 131, is the precise piece I need. It explicitly mentions that Ngọc Lương, along with other wards, is being merged into the new ward, \"Xã Yên Trị.\" This is exactly what I was hoping to find.\n\nNext, I'll cross-reference this information with the new ward data. I need to make sure that the data for \"Xã Yên Trị\" is consistent. I'm verifying the new ward data, and it shows Yên Trị as part of \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\", which agrees with what I deduced about the province name from the previous step.\n\nFinally, I'll construct the output.  Based on my findings, I'm confident about this mapping.  I will structure the JSON output with a clear citation, the relevant line from Resolution 1676, a high confidence score, and the correctly mapped province, ward code, and ward name. \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" and \"Xã Yên Trị\" are the result! The citation should reflect the specific resolution and its purpose of restructuring the administrative units. The output looks good; I have a solid and justifiable mapping.\n",
