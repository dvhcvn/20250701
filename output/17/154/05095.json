  "thought": "**Analysis of Vietnamese Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with mapping this old Vietnamese address to the new system. It's a bit of a historical puzzle, but I think I've got a solid grasp of it. The old address includes \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình,\" \"Xã Thung Nai,\" and \"Huyện Cao Phong.\"  First, I'll ignore the district for now, since I understand that districts have been eliminated in the new system.\n\nMy primary focus is on the province and ward.  Based on my knowledge, I'll dive into the resolutions and new ward data.\n\nFirst, the province.  I've checked the key province resolution, 60-NQ/TW, and it clearly states a merger involving \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" into \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  So, that settles the province. My output will definitely reflect \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" for the `province_name`.\n\nNow, the ward, \"Xã Thung Nai.\" This is where it gets interesting. I've examined resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, and line 93 is a direct hit! It explicitly states that \"Xã Thung Nai\" is *created* by merging \"Bắc Phong,\" \"Bình Thanh,\" and (crucially) the old \"Thung Nai.\" This means the *new* \"Xã Thung Nai\" exists and I have the information needed.\n\nI've also cross-referenced this with the new ward data, and, as expected, I find a record for a new ward with `ward_name` \"Xã Thung Nai\" and `province_name` \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  Perfect! It confirms the resolution.\n\nSince the resolution explicitly mentions the name of the ward, I'm confident about this mapping.  My confidence level is \"high.\"\n\nI also checked to see what happened to \"Huyện Cao Phong\", but that's not relevant to this address. I looked for other settlements that might be a part of the old \"Xã Thung Nai\", but that wasn't the case here.\n\nSo, here's my plan for the JSON output:  the citation will be from resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 93. `province_name` will be \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\"  the `ward_code` from the new ward data, and, of course, the `ward_name` will be \"Xã Thung Nai.\"  It's all quite straightforward, really.\n",
