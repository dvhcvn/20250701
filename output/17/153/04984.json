  "thought": "**Mapping an Old Vietnamese Address to a New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so I need to translate this old Vietnamese address to its current equivalent. Here's my thought process, leveraging my knowledge of administrative reorganizations and the available data:\n\nFirst, I identified the old units: \"Xã Đú Sáng\" (ward), \"Huyện Kim Bôi\" (district), and \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" (province).  I know the first step is always to check those province-level resolutions for any mergers or name changes.\n\nLooking at the province resolutions, I quickly found the relevant one. It states that \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" was merged with others, and the new province is called \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  That immediately tells me the new province.\n\nNext, I need to see what happened to the ward and district. Scanning through the other resolutions, focusing on those related to ward-level changes within Phú Thọ, I found the specific resolution addressing \"Xã Đú Sáng\" and \"Huyện Kim Bôi.\"  Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 104, explicitly states that \"Đú Sáng\" was merged along with other wards into a new ward called \"Xã Nật Sơn.\" Perfect! This is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nTo confirm and get the ward code, I checked the \"New Wards\" data.  There it is: \"Xã Nật Sơn\" with the associated ward code \"04990,\" and confirming it's now in \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  Everything aligns perfectly.\n\nNow, I can construct the JSON output. The `province_name` is \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" due to the province merger. The `ward_name` is \"Xã Nật Sơn\" because of the explicit statement in Resolution 1676. The `ward_code` is \"04990\" from the new wards data.  And, of course, I'll provide a citation pointing directly to Resolution 1676, line 104, as the source for the ward mapping.  Given the clarity of the resolution and the straightforward merge, I'm highly confident in this mapping. My `confidence` level will be high. This will be a solid and reliable mapping.\n",
