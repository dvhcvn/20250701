  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit for the Old Address**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. The user needs the current administrative location for the old address \"Xã Hùng Sơn, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\". First, I need to understand the old province, which is \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình.\"  Based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW, Hòa Bình was merged into \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" So, now I know I'm looking for a \"Xã Hùng Sơn\" within Phú Thọ.\n\nThe next step is to examine the resolutions concerning administrative changes. I need to be careful because there might be multiple places called \"Xã Hùng Sơn.\"  I'll start with the \"Other resolutions\" data.\n\nI found a mention of \"Xã Hùng Sơn\" in Đà Nẵng (Resolution 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15), but it's clearly a *new* ward formed from *old* wards, specifically a consolidation of Ch'ơm, Gari, Tr'hy and Axan. However, this is in Đà Nẵng, which is not Phú Thọ.  So, no luck there.\n\nNext, Lạng Sơn (Resolution 1672/NQ-UBTVQH15) mentioned \"Xã Hùng Sơn,\" but this time it was an *old* ward merged into \"Xã Tràng Định,\" and this is in Lạng Sơn, not Phú Thọ. Again, not the right one.\n\nNow, I'm looking at Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 for \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\" which is promising because it's the new province. This resolution mentions \"thị trấn Hùng Sơn,\" and the input is \"Xã Hùng Sơn.\"  However, \"thị trấn\" and \"xã\" are distinct administrative unit types, so the \"thị trấn Hùng Sơn\" in Phú Thọ is *unlikely* to be the same \"Xã Hùng Sơn\" from the input. I need to keep looking, but this is a useful data point.\n\nI found another entry regarding \"Xã Kim Bôi\" in this very same resolution. That's for information, as \"Huyện Kim Bôi\" is in the input address.\n\nMy conclusion so far is that while I've made some progress, the specific \"Xã Hùng Sơn\" from the input address hasn't been precisely identified. The search should continue within Phú Thọ's resolutions. I'll need to meticulously check for mentions of *old* \"Xã Hùng Sơn\" communes, not just *new* entities with that name.  The distinction between \"thị trấn\" and \"xã\" is critical.\n",
