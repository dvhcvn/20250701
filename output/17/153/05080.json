  "thought": "**Mapping an Old Vietnamese Address to New Administrative Units**\n\nOkay, so I've got this old Vietnamese address: \"Xã Sào Báy, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" and the task is to map it to the current administrative structure. My approach is pretty straightforward, relying on the provided resolutions and new ward data, which, given my expertise, should be fairly easy to execute.\n\nFirst, I identified the old province, \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình.\" Then, the first thing to check is any province-level reorganization. I scanned the province resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW, and immediately spotted the relevant entry. Turns out, \"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" has been merged into \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" So, that solves the province part.\n\nNext, I zeroed in on the ward, \"Xã Sào Báy.\" With my knowledge of these kinds of address changes, I knew to look at any ward-level adjustments. I had to focus on the other resolutions, like 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15. Skimming through the text, I found the line I was looking for. Line 103 clearly states that \"Xã Sào Báy\" was merged with a couple of other wards to form the new ward \"Xã Hợp Kim\". I'm quite confident about this.\n\nTo be extra sure, I cross-referenced the newly created \"Xã Hợp Kim\" with the \"New wards\" data.  A quick check confirmed that it does exist, with the correct province name, \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\". The ward code of \"05068\" is associated with it.\n\nFinally, I’ll construct the output, a clean JSON, mapping the old address to the new administrative unit.  I'll include the relevant province, the new ward, the ward code, and a citation to the merging resolution for proper documentation and traceability.  This is a high-confidence mapping; the resolution is explicit, and the ward data confirms everything.  This one should be good to go.\n",
