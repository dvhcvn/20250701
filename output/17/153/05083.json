  "thought": "**Navigating the Administrative Unit Shift**\n\nOkay, so I've got this old ward, \"Xã Mi Hòa, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình,\" and my task is to figure out its new administrative home. First things first, I break it down: Xã Mi Hòa is the ward, Huyện Kim Bôi is the district, and Tỉnh Hoà Bình is the province. \n\nImmediately, the province shift catches my eye.  I know about Resolution 60-NQ/TW, and sure enough, Hoà Bình is now part of Phú Thọ.  That's my starting point for this administrative geography puzzle.\n\nNext, I dive into Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, the \"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" Perfect, this is exactly what I need! I scan through it, looking specifically at Huyện Kim Bôi.  I find some mergers: Bo, Vĩnh Đồng, and Kim Bôi are going to form a new \"Kim Bôi,\" and Xuân Thủy, Bình Sơn, Đú Sáng, and Hùng Sơn are merging into \"Nật Sơn.\" But, damn it, no mention of Xã Mi Hòa!\n\nI check my \"New Wards\" list and find those merged wards, \"Kim Bôi\" and \"Nật Sơn\", but no Xã Mi Hòa.  This is a snag. I know the old district level has been eliminated, which suggests that the old ward *must* have been merged into a larger, new ward *within* Phú Thọ.  But... without any specific mention of Xã Mi Hòa in the resolutions or the provided data, I'm left hanging.  I've exhausted my search using the information given, and there simply isn't a definitive mapping possible.\n\nTherefore, because I can't find any potential candidates based solely on the provided information, I should return an empty array.\n",

It's clear I'm tasked with mapping an old administrative unit (specifically, Xã Mi Hòa, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình) to its current equivalent based on provided resolutions.  The goal is to produce a JSON output adhering to a specific schema, indicating confidence levels and relevant citations.\\n\\nFirst, I need to thoroughly understand the request.  I've identified the key components: the old ward, the desired output format, and the crucial resolutions to analyze: `60-NQ/TW` and `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  Essentially, the task boils down to methodically stepping through each resolution to identify and trace the administrative changes, specifically looking for any alterations impacting \\\"Xã Mi Hòa.\\\"\\n\\nI start by breaking down the key information: \\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\" is the ward, located in \\\"Huyện Kim Bôi\\\" district, which is part of \\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\" province.  Now, the real work begins.\\n\\nThe core of this task involves a strategic, step-by-step approach.  First, I'll need to analyze the provincial changes (Resolution `60-NQ/TW`).  I immediately recognize that this will affect the entire context. I need to find the fate of \\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\" within that resolution. Upon examining the resolution, I quickly locate Line 4, which states that \\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\" was combined with other provinces, with the new province being named \\\"Phú Thọ.\\\"  This is significant; \\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\" must now be located in \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\"\\n\\nNext, I shift my focus to ward- and district-level changes, specifically within the district \\\"Huyện Kim Bôi.\\\" Resolution `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15` comes into play here.  The very header indicates that it's dealing with ward-level changes within \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\", which aligns perfectly with my previous finding.  Now, I need to methodically check this resolution for any mentions of \\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\" or \\\"Huyện Kim Bôi.\\\"\\n\\nAfter careful examination, I spot that this resolution details mergers and new formations in the \\\"Huyện Kim Bôi\\\" area. I find \\\"xã Kim Bôi\\\" mentioned in Line 100, and in Line 104 the resolution specifies a merger in the \\\"Huyện Kim Bôi\\\" area, but critically, \\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\" is *not* one of the wards listed. This lack of a direct mention is key.\\n\\nSynthesizing my findings reveals that while \\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\" is now part of \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\\\"  and while the resolutions do address changes in the \\\"Huyện Kim Bôi\\\" area, *no direct mapping or merger for \\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\" is explicitly mentioned in the available data.*  This necessitates a low confidence level for a direct match.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Mi Hòa, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 16320,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0026536,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Navigating Administrative Changes: Mapping Old Wards to New**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so the user wants me to map an old administrative unit, specifically `Xã Mi Hòa, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình`, to its new designation, based on a set of resolutions.  Let's break this down systematically.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the request.  The user's asking me to find the new equivalent of this old ward. They've provided Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW), other ward/commune level resolutions (specifically 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Phú Thọ), and a list of new wards for context.  The output needs to be a JSON array with `ward_code`, `ward_name`, `province_name`, a `confidence` score, and the relevant `citation`.\\\\n\\\\nNow, focusing on the old ward itself: `Xã Mi Hòa` in `Huyện Kim Bôi`, `Tỉnh Hoà Bình`.  That's my starting point.\\\\n\\\\nTo tackle this, I'm thinking I'll proceed in a few clear steps.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 1: Province-Level Analysis**\\\\n\\\\nThe first order of business is to figure out the province change.  Looking at Resolution 60-NQ/TW, I quickly find that Hòa Bình was merged with Vĩnh Phúc and Phú Thọ, ultimately becoming...  *drumroll*... Phú Thọ! Okay, that narrows things down to Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 2: Delving into Ward-Level Changes**\\\\n\\\\nNow, the trickier part: finding out what happened to `Xã Mi Hòa` at the district/ward level, using those other resolutions.  Since the old province became Phú Thọ, it makes sense to focus on the resolutions related to that province.\\\\n\\\\nThe relevant resolution is 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 concerning administrative restructuring in Phú Thọ.  I'm going to carefully read this document looking for any mention of `Xã Mi Hòa` or `Huyện Kim Bôi`.\\\\n\\\\nReading the resolution, I see that they have information about:\\\\n-  \\\\\\\"thị trấn Bo\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"xã Vĩnh Đồng\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"xã Kim Bôi\\\\\\\".\\\\n-  \\\\\\\"xã Xuân Thủy (huyện Kim Bôi)\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Bình Sơn\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Đú Sáng\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"Hùng Sơn\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nHowever, nothing in this particular document mentions `Xã Mi Hòa` specifically. Hmm.\\\\n\\\\n**Step 3: Synthesis and Determination of Confidence**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so here's where my expertise comes into play. I've established that the old province is now part of Phú Thọ.  I know *which* districts and communes in Kim Bôi *were* affected by the resolution.  However, this specific resolution doesn't give a direct mapping for `Xã Mi Hòa`.\\\\n\\\\nThe challenge is the information. The provided resolutions do not have information about where `Xã Mi Hòa` went. The resolution says administrative units have been restructured, the districts are gone, and wards are being renamed/split/merged, but there's no specific rule about `Xã Mi Hòa`.  Therefore, I'd have to say that this particular request requires further investigation or external data sources to confidently determine the exact new equivalent of `Xã Mi Hòa`. I can provide the context I have, but a confident answer will require more.\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 12605,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0024611,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Address Mapping Analysis: A Deep Dive**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user's asked me to map an old Vietnamese address to its current administrative unit. I've broken down the steps I'm taking to determine the correct mapping.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I parsed the old address. It's: Xã Mi Hòa (Ward), Huyện Kim Bôi (District), Tỉnh Hoà Bình (Province). Got it. Now, the real work begins.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI'm looking at Resolution 60-NQ/TW to see what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hoà Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Bingo! Item 4 states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hoà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merged with Vĩnh Phúc and Phú Thọ to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" So, the province has changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm diving into the main resolution provided, 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Phú Thọ's administrative changes. I specifically check for the old district, Huyện Kim Bôi, as the old ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *within* that old district.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's where it gets tricky. I'm carefully reading through the resolution's merger lines. Line 100 mentions a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Bôi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" formed from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Bo\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vĩnh Đồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Kim Bôi.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It's tempting, but it doesn't mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" directly. So, low confidence on this as a solid mapping.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 104 creates \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nật Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xuân Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Bình Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Đú Sáng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hùng Sơn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" all from the old Kim Bôi district. Nope, still no \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI then review the list of new wards generated by the resolution: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Bôi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nật Sơn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" both under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the rub: I *cannot* definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to either new ward. While the resolutions detail *some* mergers within the old Kim Bôi district, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in the process. My conclusion: the information I have is incomplete. There has *likely* been a change, but without a full and complete resolution set, I can't provide the correct new administrative mapping for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I'd need more data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8483,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0029961,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating Vietnamese Administrative Restructuring**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vietnamese address mapping problem. We've got an old address: Xã Mi Hòa, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình. My mission is to figure out its new administrative unit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the components: Mi Hòa is the old ward, Kim Bôi is the old district, and Hòa Bình is the old province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I dove into the resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW tells me Hòa Bình merged into Phú Thọ. So, we're definitely looking at Phú Thọ now.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThen, Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically focusing on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", caught my eye.  I started scanning for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Mi Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kim Bôi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I found a line (100) detailing a merger within Huyện Kim Bôi, resulting in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Bôi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". But, crucially, Mi Hòa isn't explicitly mentioned. Another line (104) described a merger resulting in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nật Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but again, no mention of Mi Hòa.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI checked the provided new ward data: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Bôi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nật Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy analysis reveals a few key points.  Hoà Bình is now Phú Thọ, and Kim Bôi is now under the Phú Thọ administration. The resolutions clearly describe changes within Kim Bôi, but not to Mi Hòa specifically. The problem states most wards have been restructured, eliminating all districts. Since Mi Hòa isn't mentioned, I can't definitively determine its fate. It could be part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Bôi,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nật Sơn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or another unlisted ward, or it could have remained unchanged, though the problem leans towards change.  Given the information available, I can only state that while some wards from Kim Bôi were merged into Xã Kim Bôi and Xã Nật Sơn, the fate of Xã Mi Hòa is currently uncertain. Further information is needed to determine the precise new administrative unit for this old address.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc, tỉnh Phú Thọ và tỉnh Hoà Bình; lấy tên là tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"04978\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Bôi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Vĩnh Phúc, tỉnh Phú Thọ và tỉnh Hoà Bình; lấy tên là tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"04990\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nật Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n  ],\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa, Huyện Kim Bôi, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8215,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0029961,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tasked with mapping this old Vietnamese address to its current administrative unit. It's a bit tricky because the problem statement suggests significant changes have occurred at the ward level, even eliminating districts. Let's see...\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the old address components: Xã Mi Hòa (ward), Huyện Kim Bôi (district), and Tỉnh Hoà Bình (province). Step one, check.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, based on the provided resolutions, I need to figure out the province's current status. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Tỉnh Hoà Bình was merged with Vĩnh Phúc and Phú Thọ to form Tỉnh Phú Thọ.  So, right off the bat, I know the new province is definitely Tỉnh Phú Thọ. That part is clear.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Phú Thọ's administrative adjustments, is key.  I scanned it for any mention of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mi Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kim Bôi.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Line 100 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Kim Bôi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and also references \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Kim Bôi,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but it deals with the merger of Bo, Vĩnh Đồng, and Kim Bôi *within* the district. Xã Mi Hòa isn't listed here. Line 104 deals with mergers creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nật Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but, again, no mention of Xã Mi Hòa.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe new ward data confirms \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kim Bôi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nật Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" exist within Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy analysis now tells me that the province changed from Tỉnh Hoà Bình to Tỉnh Phú Thọ, meaning the old district, Huyện Kim Bôi is now part of Phú Thọ. The resolutions describe changes and mergers in this district, but I cannot definitively pinpoint the fate of Xã Mi Hòa. The resolutions describe mergers into Kim Bôi and Nật Sơn but are not mentioned in either of the two.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe problem statement indicates significant ward changes, so, while it's *possible* Xã Mi Hòa was merged into Xã Kim Bôi, Xã Nật Sơn, or into another unlisted ward, I don't have definitive proof. It's also possible that, contrary to the problem statement, Xã Mi Hòa remains unchanged.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, given the available data, I can't definitively determine the current ward for Xã Mi Hòa.
