  "thought": "**Navigating the Administrative Landscape: Identifying the New Unit for Phú Nghĩa in Hòa Bình**\n\nOkay, so I've got \"Xã Phú Nghĩa, Huyện Lạc Thủy, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" and I need to figure out its new administrative home. First, I know Hòa Bình is the key here, and I'm well aware of the consolidation history. My initial thought is to cross-reference my comprehensive database of province and ward resolutions with a particular focus on Hòa Bình.\n\nStep one is straightforward: identify the old province, which is Hòa Bình. Given my knowledge, I'm already aware of the key resolution, 60-NQ/TW, regarding territorial adjustments. This resolution led to a merger where Hòa Bình essentially became part of Phú Thọ.\n\nThe next step is to examine resolutions that pertain to Hòa Bình, keeping Phú Thọ in mind now as the relevant province. I need to comb through these resolutions and specifically look for \"Xã Phú Nghĩa\" or anything that sounds like a potential shift. I am going to cross reference the resolutions I am aware of with my database.\nI've got a list of resolutions to check. I quickly dismiss a few that are clearly not relevant, focusing on the resolutions for Hà Nội, Đồng Nai, and Nghệ An.\n\nThe key is resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Phú Thọ, the province that now encompasses Hòa Bình. Bingo! This is the one. Section 115 of this resolution explicitly states that \"Xã Phú Nghĩa\" *and other* wards now make up the new administrative unit called **Xã An Nghĩa**.\n\nNow I'll check my \"New wards\" list for \"Xã An Nghĩa\" in \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" to confirm the details I found in the resolution. A quick scan reveals a perfect match: {\"ward_code\":\"05395\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã An Nghĩa\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\"}. So it's confirmed, \"Xã Phú Nghĩa\" in the given old address, has been consolidated into Xã An Nghĩa in Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\n\nAs a final check, I will quickly browse for other \"Xã Phú Nghĩa\" to see if I have any further information to verify.\n\nThere are a few other \"Xã Phú Nghĩa\" that exist, but they are in Hà Nội and Đồng Nai, and both kept the same name. They're irrelevant to the initial address, which had the original \"Xã Phú Nghĩa\" and original Hoà Bình province, as it relates to the given old address.\n\nTherefore, the new administrative unit for \"Xã Phú Nghĩa, Huyện Lạc Thủy, Tỉnh Hoà Bình\" is indeed **Xã An Nghĩa**, now located in **Tỉnh Phú Thọ**.\n",
