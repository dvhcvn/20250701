  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with figuring out the new ward for the old address \"Xã Vĩnh Ninh, Huyện Quảng Ninh, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\". My initial approach is to break it down: \"Xã Vĩnh Ninh\" is the ward, \"Huyện Quảng Ninh\" is the district, and \"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\" is the province. I'll need to meticulously go through the resolutions provided to find the corresponding new unit.\n\nFirst, I looked at the province-level changes (60-NQ/TW).  Thankfully, Quảng Bình *wasn't* on the list of provinces that wouldn't be merged. Then, bingo!  It mentioned that Quảng Bình and Quảng Trị had merged to form the new province of Quảng Trị.  This is HUGE because it immediately establishes that the new province for \"Xã Vĩnh Ninh\" is now \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\"\n\nNext, I shifted to examining the other resolutions. I flagged resolution 1675/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns Huế and mentions \"phường Vĩnh Ninh.\"  However, I quickly dismissed this as a potential match since the old address is a *xã* and the context is *thành phố Huế*, not relevant to the rural context of Quảng Bình.\n\nThen I checked resolution 1679/NQ-UBTVQH15 about \"Tỉnh Quảng Ninh\". Again, irrelevant. The old address is in Quảng Bình. But then, it became clear that resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\", was the key! This resolution is directly relevant because it deals with the new province resulting from the merger.  And there it was: it mentions \"xã Vĩnh Ninh\" along with other wards in the region.  It even states that \"thị trấn Quán Hàu và các xã Vĩnh Ninh, Võ Ninh, Hàm Ninh\" is consolidated into a new *xã*.\n\nBased on this, and considering the provincial merger, my conclusion is clear. The new administrative unit for \"Xã Vĩnh Ninh\" will be within the scope of resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15. Further analysis would involve determining the *exact* new name or administrative unit, but based on the provided data, I'm confident that the new ward is now under the umbrella of \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\" as a consolidated unit within the framework of this resolution. The district details are less relevant because the key change is province-level and consolidation. My next step would be to drill down within that specific resolution to pinpoint the new unit name, but I have a strong foundation for the user's answer.\n",
