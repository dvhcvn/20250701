  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Reorganization for Xã Xuân Ninh**\n\nOkay, here's my breakdown of what's happening with \"Xã Xuân Ninh, Huyện Quảng Ninh, Tỉnh Quảng Bình.\" My goal is to determine the new administrative unit after the restructuring, using my expertise in this area.\n\nFirst things first, I've got to break down the original address: It's \"Xã Xuân Ninh\" within \"Huyện Quảng Ninh\" (district) in \"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\" (province). The prompt specifically mentions eliminating districts, so the district information is probably less crucial for the final output, but it's vital context.\n\nNow, let's dive into the resolutions. The key here is Provincial Resolutions, particularly resolution **60-NQ/TW**. It explicitly states that \"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\" is *not* one of the provinces exempt from mergers. More importantly, it says that Quảng Bình has been merged with \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\", forming the new province of \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\" Boom. That's the first crucial piece of the puzzle. So, \"Xã Xuân Ninh,\" regardless of any other changes, is now located in \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\".\n\nNext, I've got to look through other resolutions to find the specific ward-level changes. I know from experience that this is where things can get tricky. I checked several resolutions:\n\n*   **1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Khánh Hòa):** No luck here.\n*   **1674/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Ninh Bình):** This one *does* mention \"Xuân Ninh\", but it's clearly a different \"Xuân Ninh\" in a different province (\"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\").\n*   **1679/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Quảng Ninh):** No match.\n*   **1680/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Quảng Trị):** This is the one to focus on because it's in the province that absorbed Quảng Bình. However, it seems to be more about reorganizing wards within Quảng Trị after the merger.\n\nThis is where my familiarity with these resolutions kicks in. It seems like a new ward called \"xã Quảng Ninh\" was formed from Quán Hàu, Vĩnh Ninh, Võ Ninh, and Hàm Ninh. While this is helpful context, none of the resolutions directly tell me what happened specifically to my original location. I see no mention of it.\n\nGiven the information available, I conclude:\n\n*   The *province* for \"Xã Xuân Ninh\" is now \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\".\n*   I can't say for certain, with just the given resolutions, what changes, if any, occurred at the level of the *ward* \"Xã Xuân Ninh.\" It's possible \"Xã Xuân Ninh\" remains, but I can't confirm that from this data.\n",
