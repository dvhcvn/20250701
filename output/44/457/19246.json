I need to figure out which *new* ward(s) correspond to the *old* \"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\" based on these provided resolutions.\n\nFirst, I looked at the old ward's province and found that \"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\" is now part of \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\" according to resolution `60-NQ/TW`.  So, we're dealing with a *new* location in Quảng Trị.\n\nNext, I noted that the districts are being eliminated, so \"Huyện Lệ Thủy\" no longer exists as an administrative level. However, the geographical location (\"Lệ Thủy\") is important.\n\nResolution `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15` details the changes. I started looking for mentions of \"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\" or \"Lệ Thủy.\"  I found that \"Xã Lệ Thủy\" and \"Xã Cam Hồng\" were created from other wards within the old \"Huyện Lệ Thủy\". *However*, and this is crucial, **\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\" is NOT explicitly mentioned anywhere in these resolutions.**\n\nSince \"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\" is not directly mentioned, I can't be *certain* which new ward it's a part of. However, \"Xã Lệ Thủy\" and \"Xã Cam Hồng\" are strong *possibilities* because they were formed from wards in the old \"Huyện Lệ Thủy\". I need to include these with the lowest confidence levels because there is no direct evidence.\n\nThe new list includes \"Xã Mỹ Thủy\". While I cannot confirm this with the resolution, I need to include it as a possibility since there is no complete data provided.\n\nTherefore, my final approach is to generate a JSON array with these three possible candidates (\"Xã Lệ Thủy,\" \"Xã Cam Hồng,\" and \"Xã Mỹ Thủy\"), all with a \"low\" confidence, because there's no definite match for the old \"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\". I'll cite the relevant resolution lines for the creation of \"Xã Lệ Thủy\" and \"Xã Cam Hồng\", but will have no supporting line for \"Xã Mỹ Thủy\".\n",

My understanding is that the goal is to pinpoint the location of this specific ward now.\\n\\nFirst, I need to break this down. The key components are the old ward's specifics (Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình), the task itself (finding the new location), the input data (province resolutions and a specific resolution for Quảng Trị), the new wards list, and the desired JSON output format. I need to go through each resolution, identify any mentions of this old ward, and pinpoint the corresponding new units, with confidence levels and citations. The final output must be a valid JSON array.\\n\\nNow, let's dive into the analysis. I start with the old ward. Then, I check the province resolutions (60-NQ/TW).  Aha! Tỉnh Quảng Bình and Tỉnh Quảng Trị merged, with the new name being Tỉnh Quảng Trị.  So, this old ward is now within the boundaries of Tỉnh Quảng Trị. That's a vital piece of the puzzle.\\n\\nNext, I look into the specific resolution for Quảng Trị: `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15`. This resolution details the restructuring of wards in Quảng Trị, specifically in Huyện Lệ Thủy, which is relevant.  I examine each line. I find that this resolution does not explicitly mention \\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh.\\\" Some merging and renaming are described in lines 29 and 30, but those do not match.\\n\\nTherefore, although I know Tỉnh Quảng Bình is now part of Tỉnh Quảng Trị, and this resolution is relevant as it pertains to Huyện Lệ Thủy, the specific old ward I'm looking for is *not directly mentioned* in this resolution. Given the statement about district-level eliminations and ward changes, I'll need to further analyze the \\\"New Wards List\\\" to determine the new unit that *might* contain the old ward, with a *low* confidence level. I'll need to present this result as a possible, but uncertain, mapping.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 15772,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0027664,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Processing the Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I've got this request to map an old administrative unit, specifically \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình,\\\\\\\" to its new counterpart(s) using these resolutions. First, I need to break this down. The core task is to find the new ward(s) that encompass the old one, either fully or partially. I have province resolutions (like 60-NQ/TW) that likely describe province mergers and renames, plus this JSON array of specific resolutions about ward-level changes, particularly `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Quảng Trị province. Then there's the list of new wards for reference. The desired output is a JSON array with citation, confidence, province, code and ward names.\\\\n\\\\nFirst things first, I've got to analyze the location of this old ward. It's in Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, which is in Huyện Lệ Thủy, Quảng Bình province. Now, I need to consult those province-level resolutions (60-NQ/TW). Scanning through, I quickly find that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\" was merged with \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\" to become the new \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\". So, the old \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\" is now geographically situated within the newly established province of Quảng Trị.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I have to dive into those \\\\\\\"Other Resolutions\\\\\\\" – specifically `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15`. This resolution details changes within the Quảng Trị province. Since the old province is now part of the new one, this is relevant. I'm focusing on \\\\\\\"Huyện Lệ Thủy,\\\\\\\" the old district. I need to locate mentions of it in the lines of this resolution.\\\\n\\\\nNow, looking at the resolution, I'm finding mentions of \\\\\\\"huyện Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\", specifically lines 29 and 30. Line 29 describes a merge which creates \\\\\\\"xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\". Line 30 also describes a merge within \\\\\\\"huyện Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\" creating \\\\\\\"xã Cam Hồng\\\\\\\". However, and this is crucial, the specific old ward, \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh,\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly listed in either of these lines. So, this warrants a closer look.\\\\n\\\\nTo summarize my findings and evaluate the confidence: The original province, \\\\\\\"Quảng Bình,\\\\\\\" has been incorporated into \\\\\\\"Quảng Trị\\\\\\\". Resolution mentions districts but does not specify the old ward. It is uncertain where it currently resides. I will state the citation is unknown as this ward is not referenced in the resolution.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 14892,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0030164000000000002,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants the new administrative unit for that old address. First things first, I need to analyze the components: the ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the district \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and the province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe initial hurdle is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't what it used to be. Checking the province mergers, I see that Quảng Bình was combined with Quảng Trị to form... well, Quảng Trị.  So, the *new* province is definitely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the tricky part: the district and ward. The provided resolution, 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerns changes within Quảng Trị.  Perfect, it's relevant. But reading through the lines, it highlights the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cam Hồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the old Huyện Lệ Thủy district. It appears to be a major restructuring of units within the former district. But... and this is the rub... *my* old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", isn't mentioned explicitly in this resolution.  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the list of new wards for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", I see those two (Xã Lệ Thủy and Xã Cam Hồng), and also Xã Mỹ Thủy. But none of them seem to correspond to the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Given the context and the problem statement, I have to consider all the districts as eliminated.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Final assessment:** While I'm certain the province is now Quảng Trị, I lack definitive information about the specific fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The resolution focuses on the creation of new wards *within the old district*, but doesn't provide a direct mapping or renaming for my target. There is no information provided about what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". So I am at a loss.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 7821,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0028514,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Complexities of Administrative Unit Mapping**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I've got this old address to decipher: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My task is to figure out where this fits in the new administrative landscape, based on the provided resolutions and ward data. Let's break it down.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the old province and ward. The old province is straightforward: Tỉnh Quảng Bình. The ward is a bit trickier. The address mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but the resolutions primarily reference \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kiến Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and several other communes. I need to figure out the relationship between \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and these other units.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to account for province mergers, specifically Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This one's clear: Quảng Bình merged with Quảng Trị, resulting in the new province of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the crucial step: ward resolutions. Resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Quảng Trị, is where the magic happens. I spotted line 29: it merges \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kiến Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and several communes into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lệ Thủy.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" And line 30 talks about the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Cam Hồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere's the rub. The old address specifies \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Is this equivalent to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kiến Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"? Based on the context, it's highly likely that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is either \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kiến Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or another commune that was merged into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It's within the Lệ Thủy district, and the resolution shows that everything in the district was reorganized. I'm assuming it has been merged with Kiến Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I have the new ward data to consider: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lệ Thủy,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cam Hồng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Given the high probability that  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lệ Thủy,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I can then map that old address to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Without an explicit confirmation, my confidence in this mapping remains slightly lower.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Quảng Bình và tỉnh Quảng Trị, lấy tên là tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"19249\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\n  ],\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8005,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0028514,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Complexities of Administrative Unit Mapping**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I've got this address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh, Huyện Lệ Thủy, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and need to figure out its new administrative unit based on the provided resolutions and new ward data. This is a classic historical mapping problem, so let's break it down.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, the easy part: identifying the old province and ward.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is clear for the province, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the old ward.  Now, the tricky part... this is where I need to be careful.  The resolutions talk about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kiến Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and several other communes, all within Lệ Thủy district. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned. This immediately throws a flag.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to check for any province mergers. The key resolution, 60-NQ/TW, states that Quảng Bình merged with Quảng Trị. So, the new province is definitely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Good, one hurdle cleared.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the crucial step: ward resolutions, specifically 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15.  This one deals with administrative changes in Quảng Trị, which is what I'm after. Line 29 is key: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kiến Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and several communes were merged into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Line 30 speaks of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Cam Hồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHere's the rub: I need to connect \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to these resolutions.  Given that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Kiến Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are both towns within the old Lệ Thủy district, and the resolution merges *several* wards to form xã Lệ Thủy, it's highly *probable* that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is either equivalent to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Kiến Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or part of the collective that makes up \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" . Unfortunately, without additional context or historical data confirming the relationship between them, this mapping is not definable.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I have to consider the new ward data. I see options like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lệ Thủy,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Cam Hồng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Thủy,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" all in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Based on the resolutions, if I can confirm  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lệ Thủy,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" then that would be the correct match. However, because I cannot define the direct match, I need to flag this mapping as uncertain. My confidence here is going to be low, unless further research solidifies the connection between \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Lệ Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Quảng Bình và tỉnh Quảng Trị, lấy tên là tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"19249\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lệ Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
