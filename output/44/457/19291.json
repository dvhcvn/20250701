  "thought": "**Deconstructing an Old Vietnamese Address**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a Vietnamese address and I need to figure out its modern equivalent based on some administrative changes. The old address is from Quảng Bình province, specifically Xã Dương Thủy, in Lệ Thủy district.\n\nFirst things first, I need to check for province-level changes. Resolution 60-NQ/TW is my starting point for provincial reorganizations.  Quảng Bình isn't listed in the \"no merge\" list, but it *is* in the list of mergers. It looks like Quảng Bình merged with Quảng Trị to form... well, Quảng Trị.  So, I've got a provincial change to consider.\n\nNext, I dig into Resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with ward-level changes within Quảng Trị (the *new* province, thanks to the merge).  I'm looking for \"Dương Thủy\" within the resolution text, and bingo! Line 32 explicitly states that Dương Thủy, along with Tân Thủy, Mỹ Thủy, and Thái Thủy, are *merged* to create a new ward: **Tân Mỹ**.  That's my primary lead.\n\nNow, I check the \"New wards\" data. I find an entry for \"Xã Tân Mỹ\" in Quảng Trị, which is a perfect match. I'm confident about this mapping based on the resolution's clear language.\n\nHowever, things get a bit confusing. There's also an entry for \"Xã Mỹ Thủy\" in the \"New wards\" data. This is a bit of a head-scratcher. The resolution specifically said Mỹ Thủy *becomes* part of Tân Mỹ.  If this \"Xã Mỹ Thủy\" is the same one from the merge, it shouldn't exist as a *separate* ward now, since the resolution states its complete inclusion into Tân Mỹ. Perhaps the resolution doesn't represent the final state, or the term \"Mỹ Thủy\" has been re-used in a different context within Quảng Trị's new administrative divisions.\n\nBased on the instructions, I need to include all possible candidates. Given that the resolution explicitly names Mỹ Thủy as one of the source wards for Tân Mỹ, \"Xã Tân Mỹ\" is a clear and direct match and \"Xã Mỹ Thủy\" is a possible candidate if the resolution doesn't completely represent the final state. While it goes against the resolution, I'll need to flag this ambiguity when I report the findings.",
