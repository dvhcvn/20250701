  "thought": "**Analysis and Synthesis of Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user's asking me to find the new equivalent of \"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung, Huyện Bố Trạch, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\" based on the resolutions provided. I see a couple of resolutions: 60-NQ/TW and 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15. I've got to ensure the output is a JSON array, stick to the prescribed schema, and properly cite my sources. Crucially, I must flag uncertainty with a 'low' confidence level when the information's shaky.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the old ward. It's a \"Thị trấn\" (Town) within the \"Huyện\" (District) of \"Bố Trạch\", which belongs to \"Tỉnh\" (Province) \"Quảng Bình\". Got it.\n\nNext up, the resolutions. 60-NQ/TW is dealing with provinces. It seems \"Quảng Bình\" got merged with \"Quảng Trị,\" becoming \"Quảng Trị.\" So, the new province is definitely \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\". That's straightforward.\n\nThen, 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15 is at the ward/commune level, which is what I'm interested in now that the provinces are done. This resolution is looking at \"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Trị,\" which means \"Rearrangement of commune-level administrative units of Quảng Trị province.\" It covers \"Huyện Bố Trạch.\" I'm looking for \"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\" or anything related. Line 21 mentions \"Xã Đông Trạch\" being formed from other communes in Huyện Bố Trạch. Then Line 23 notes a new \"Xã Bố Trạch\" (Bố Trạch Commune) also from Huyện Bố Trạch. But the crucial piece is that \"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\" *isn't* explicitly mentioned in either of those lines. Hmm...\n\nSince my target wasn't explicitly mentioned, I must extrapolate. \"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\" became part of \"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\" Good. The old district, \"Huyện Bố Trạch,\" saw some reorganizations creating \"Xã Đông Trạch\" and \"Xã Bố Trạch.\" Since the original \"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\" *was* in Huyện Bố Trạch, these are prime candidates, but I have no *proof* it was absorbed by either. It could be a third option not included in the snippet.\n\nBecause of this, I'm going with 'low' confidence. Both \"Xã Bố Trạch\" and \"Xã Đông Trạch\" are listed in the provided new ward lists. \"Xã Bố Trạch\" is especially suggestive because it is formed from communes from the old \"Huyện Bố Trạch\" and they share the same name. It is, by its name, a highly plausible candidate, but without explicit confirmation in the text, it's speculative. The proximity of the target to the other potential ward \"Xã Đông Trạch\" makes them both likely.\n\nMy final output is going to be a JSON array. Each object will contain the new ward with province, ward code and name, a low confidence level and a citation from the resolution. Let's make sure that the output is syntactically correct: double quotes, no trailing commas, no comments.\n",

The core task is to find the new wards encompassing this old one, based on the provided resolutions. I need to treat the user's input as the initial task, it is to provide a valid JSON array as an output.\\n\\n**Data Source Analysis and Preliminary Steps**\\n\\nMy initial analysis reveals I'm working with two primary data sources: the Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW), detailing province mergers, and other Resolutions (1680/NQ-UBTVQH15), which seem to focus on commune/ward changes in Quảng Trị.  Crucially, I also have a \\\"New Wards List\\\" that I'll need to cross-reference later.  The requested output JSON must be valid, conforming to the specified schema, and importantly, must include *all* potential matches, with confidence levels marked as needed. The key is to find mentions of \\\"Bố Trạch\\\" and \\\"Quảng Bình\\\" in the resolutions.\\n\\n**Step-by-Step Resolution Mapping**\\n\\nNow, I'll go through the steps. First, analyzing the province resolutions. I see the merging of Quảng Bình and Quảng Trị into a new province, Quảng Trị. This means the old \\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\" is now part of the new \\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\". Next, I'll analyze the other resolution, 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, to see if it lists mentions of \\\"huyện Bố Trạch\\\" and the name \\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\". This document has the header \\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\". I search the resolution to look for mentions of \\\"Bố Trạch\\\" to find the correct mapping. Looking for \\\"Bố Trạch\\\" in resolution, I noticed two lines related to this. First, Line 21 discusses the merging of Hải Phú, Sơn Lộc, Đức Trạch, Đồng Trạch into xã Đông Trạch. The requested ward is not in the line. Second, Line 23, \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Hưng Trạch, Cự Nẫm, Vạn Trạch và Phú Định thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Bố Trạch**,\\\" mentioning the merging of Hưng Trạch, Cự Nẫm, Vạn Trạch, and Phú Định into a new \\\"xã Bố Trạch\\\". But again, the requested ward is not in this line. I need to make some notes: The new district has the same name as the old one, Huyện Bố Trạch.\\n\\n**Synthesis and Final Output (To be Continued)**\\n\\nSo far, I've established the province change (Quảng Bình -> Quảng Trị). Now, I need to check the \\\"New Wards List\\\" against these findings to identify the best candidates and construct the JSON output. I will need to consider the context to make a valid guess, then proceed.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1680/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Trị\",\n        \"line\": \"23.

My task is to figure out the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung, Huyện Bố Trạch, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\" based on the provided resolutions. I need to output the result in a specific JSON format. Here's my thinking process:\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I broke down the request. I know the old ward, district, and province. I have two sets of resolutions: one about province-level changes (60-NQ/TW) and another specific to ward-level changes, which is `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15`. I need to figure out how these resolutions impact the old ward.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I analyzed the old ward. I have \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch\\\\\\\" (Bố Trạch District) of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\" (Quảng Bình Province).\\\\n\\\\nNow for the step-by-step analysis:\\\\n\\\\n**Province-level Changes (Resolution 60-NQ/TW):** The 60-NQ/TW resolution mentions provinces being merged or renamed. Looking at it, \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\" is combined with \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\". So, the old province is now part of the new \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\". This is a key finding.\\\\n\\\\n**District-level Changes:** The user states that districts are being eliminated. This means I need to look for ward changes within the area of the old \\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch\\\\\\\" district.\\\\n\\\\n**Ward-level Changes (Other Resolutions):** I focused on resolution `1680/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which pertains to \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\" Good, that's where I need to be.  This is where things get interesting.  I need to scan this resolution, line by line, to see how it affects the old district.\\\\n\\\\n- The resolution states the creation of a new ward named `xã Đông Trạch` by merging several communes from \\\\\\\"huyện Bố Trạch.\\\\\\\"\\\\n- It also states the creation of a new ward named `xã Bố Trạch` from the merging of other communes.\\\\n\\\\nHere's the problem: The old ward, \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung,\\\\\\\" is not explicitly mentioned in either of those lines. This means a direct mapping is not readily available. My confidence is lower because the exact fate of \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\" is not clearly defined in the provided data. Further investigation might be needed to determine the exact new unit or units it now belongs to.  I need to consider the context of the district eliminations and ward mergers within the larger province restructuring. I will need to flag that the determination of this unit requires further analysis.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"9.

First, I need to break down the old address: ward, district, and province. Then, I have to check for any province mergers or renamings.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe province is straightforward – \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Checking the relevant resolutions, particularly 60-NQ/TW, I confirm that Quảng Bình merged with Quảng Trị to become \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Good, that part's easy.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the trickier part is the district and ward. The user mentioned that all districts were eliminated. Examining the resolutions, I see that they focus on merging communes/wards. Resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, related to Quảng Trị, is particularly relevant. It outlines the merging of several wards in the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI need to see if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is mentioned in this resolution. It isn't explicitly. However, the resolution creates new wards named \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from the territory of the old district. Since the old ward was part of the old district, it's *possible* it was absorbed into one of these new wards.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe resolution lists the merging of several old wards, but not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I don't see an explicit mapping. However, the new ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is very interesting as it shares the name of the old district. And \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" includes communes from the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", too.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on the provided resolutions, I can identify two new wards: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the correct new province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). These new wards are clearly the result of merging communes from the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as per resolution 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15. However, because the specific ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* listed in this resolution, I'd have to say it's impossible to determine precisely where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" ended up.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"19141\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"19159\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung, Huyện Bố Trạch, Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 9799,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0032584999999999997,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Navigating the Vietnamese Administrative Landscape**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with an old Vietnamese address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My task is to map this to the new administrative structure, leveraging the provided resolutions and new ward data. This is an interesting challenge given the frequent changes in Vietnamese administrative units.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst things first, I need to break down the old address into its core components. We have the ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the district, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This is straightforward enough.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I turn my attention to the provincial-level changes dictated by Resolution 60-NQ/TW. I scan the lists for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Aha! It's *not* in the list of provinces that remained untouched. Instead, it's listed under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Specifically, item 9 tells me that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form... well, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  That's a pretty clear-cut, high-confidence change. The province is now undoubtedly \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the ward level gets trickier.  I move on to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specifically 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15, to see if I can find any direct information about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I comb through the lines, looking for any mention of my target.  I find that other wards within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are being reorganized to form new wards: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". But crucially, I don't see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" explicitly mentioned. This is where things get fuzzy.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe resolutions *do* provide context: they deal with *some* communes within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" They've clearly been active in renaming and merging at the ward level. But the lack of direct mention of my target ward is concerning.  The prompt stated that most wards have been affected by changes. It's plausible that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was absorbed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or perhaps renamed, but there's no concrete evidence to that effect.  Since it is not explicitly stated in this data, it is not clear.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy exploration of the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data reveals the existence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" – formed from other old wards within Bố Trạch. This reinforces the broader pattern of ward restructuring.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, the only high-confidence mapping I can provide is the province: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I have insufficient information to definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new ward based solely on the provided data.  My confidence in the ward-level mapping is low because of this lack of information.

It looks like it's in the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" ward, within the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" district, and the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" province. Straightforward enough, right? Let's break this down.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the key components of the address: ward, district, and province. Then, I dug into the available resolutions and new ward data. The first thing I checked was the province mapping using the resolution (60-NQ/TW). Bingo! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wasn't listed under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"no changes,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"mergers,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I found that Quảng Bình and Quảng Trị had combined. This gives me high confidence in the province change: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I turned my attention to the ward level and checked the other resolutions (1680/NQ-UBTVQH15). I was looking specifically for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I scanned through those lines, and though I found mentions of the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and some wards within that district, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wasn't explicitly mentioned. The resolutions did outline the formation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from other old wards, but these details didn't help me determine the fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That's the tricky part - I don't know if it was merged, renamed, or perhaps remained unchanged.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo clarify my thought process, I checked what was available to help. I looked at the new wards I had: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Those were created, as indicated by the resolutions, from other wards within Bố Trạch district, but I didn't see any explicit connection to my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSince I didn't find \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the resolution lines, I have to be conservative. The prompt says, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Most of the wards have been renamed / split or merged. A small number of the wards are kept unchanged.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I'm missing something important here. Without that explicit mapping in the ward-level resolutions, I can't confidently map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Việt Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new specific ward, even though the district is mentioned. I am certain of the province mapping, but the specifics of that ward are a mystery without more data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Quảng Bình và tỉnh Quảng Trị, lấy tên là tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1680/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Hải Phú (huyện Bố Trạch), Sơn Lộc, Đức Trạch và Đồng Trạch thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Đông Trạch.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"19159\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đông Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1680/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Hưng Trạch, Cự Nẫm, Vạn Trạch và Phú Định thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Bố Trạch.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Trị\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"19141\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bố Trạch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
