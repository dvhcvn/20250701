My goal is to determine the current administrative unit for the old address \"Xã Tân Minh, Huyện Thanh Sơn, Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  First, I'm checking for province-level mergers. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Phú Thọ was indeed merged with Vinh Phuc and Hoa Binh, but ultimately retained the name \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\" so that's simple enough.\n\nNow, the real work begins. I need to sift through these resolutions to see if \"Xã Tân Minh\" and \"Huyện Thanh Sơn\" underwent any changes. The key here is to look for mentions of these names in the context of Phú Thọ, or potentially in the context of the provinces that merged into Phú Thọ (Vĩnh Phúc and Hòa Bình), just in case there were any antecedent reorganizations.\n\nSo, I'm methodically going through the resolutions. I've already realized that there are multiple \"Tân Minhs\" out there, and I need to be careful to filter out irrelevant ones. For example, the resolution about Hà Nội has two \"Tân Minhs\" but neither is in the right area. Similarly, Hưng Yên, Đồng Nai, Khánh Hòa, Hải Phòng, Lâm Đồng, and Lạng Sơn also have \"Tân Minh\" mentions, but they are all in the wrong province. That Lạng Sơn mention could be interesting, but I need to make sure to cross reference it with other sources.\n\nIt looks like the search continues.  I'll keep a sharp eye out for anything referencing Phú Thọ or the former provinces.  I might need to consult external datasets if I don't find anything in these resolutions.  This is a process of elimination and pattern recognition, and I'll keep refining my search criteria as I go.\n",
