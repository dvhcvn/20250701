  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Lai Đồng, Huyện Tân Sơn, Tỉnh Phú Thọ\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to find the new administrative unit for that old address. My approach is pretty straightforward, following these steps:\n\nFirst, I need to confirm if there were any province-level changes. After quickly checking, I see that \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" remained unchanged. Next, I jump into the detailed work: looking for any relevant ward mergers or adjustments within \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  My focus is on the \"Other resolutions\" where these changes are typically documented.\n\nSpecifically, I'm keying into Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with administrative adjustments for that particular province. Bingo! Line 50 of that resolution is the gold mine. It clearly states that \"Xã Lai Đồng,\" along with several other \"xã,\" are merged to form a *new* \"Xã Lai Đồng.\"  The name, importantly, remains the same.  This merger signifies a change in boundaries and composition, but the name is preserved.\n\nTo be absolutely certain, I'll then cross-reference this information with the list of \"New wards.\"  I expect to find an entry for \"Xã Lai Đồng\" and it's there: `{\"ward_code\":\"08560\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Lai Đồng\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\"}`. This perfectly aligns with my findings from the resolution.\n\nAlthough the original address included \"Huyện Tân Sơn,\" that information isn't directly used for the final mapping.  The key is the resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 focused on \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" where the old ward is located. The district merely helps to locate the old ward within the correct province.\n\nSo, with high confidence, I can definitively say that the new administrative unit, the new ward, is still \"Xã Lai Đồng,\" but it's now defined by the merged boundaries described in the resolution.  The ward code is \"08560,\" and it's located within \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\"  This is a direct, reliable mapping based on explicit language from the relevant legal documents.\n",
