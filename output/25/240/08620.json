The request is to identify the new administrative unit for \"Xã Tam Thanh\" in Phú Thọ province. First, I confirmed that Phú Thọ remains its own province; there were some mergers, but the name didn't change.  Then, I focused on resolutions related to administrative rearrangements within Phú Thọ.  Specifically, I found Resolution `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  Line 52 of that resolution is the key. It clearly states that \"Xã Tam Thanh\" was merged with other wards to form a new ward named \"Xã Long Cốc\".\n\nThe next step was to confirm the ward code for \"Xã Long Cốc\" within the relevant data.  I located the entry with the ward code \"08620\" for \"Xã Long Cốc\".  My confidence is high because of the direct mention in the resolution, and it's a very clear case.  To ensure accuracy, I double-checked other resolutions to eliminate any possible confusion with other wards named \"Tam Thanh\" in other provinces.  There were mentions in Đà Nẵng, Lâm Đồng, Lạng Sơn, and Thanh Hóa, but none of those were relevant because they are distinct units (different provinces or a \"phường\" instead of a \"xã\") or they had a clear statement that \"Tam Thanh\" was not affected in the restructuring.\n\nTherefore, the old \"Xã Tam Thanh\" is now part of \"Xã Long Cốc\" with the ward code \"08620\", a high confidence resolution based on the cited resolution `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15`.\n",
