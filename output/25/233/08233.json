  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Change for \"Xã Phú Mỹ, Huyện Phù Ninh, Tỉnh Phú Thọ\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to pinpoint the new administrative unit for \"Xã Phú Mỹ, Huyện Phù Ninh, Tỉnh Phú Thọ.\" My first thought is to dig into the relevant resolutions and new ward data.  I need to make sure I don't overlook any subtleties, especially since administrative reorganizations can get complex.\n\nFirst things first, I checked for any province-level changes. The initial query mentioned \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\" so I needed to ensure it hadn't been merged or renamed. The resolutions I checked (specifically 60-NQ/TW) didn't show any province-level alterations. Good, that simplifies things.\n\nNow, the focus shifts to the district and *xã* levels.  I zeroed in on the resolutions specifically pertaining to \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ,\" paying close attention to any mention of \"Xã Phú Mỹ\" and \"Huyện Phù Ninh.\"  Resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 jumped out.\n\nLine 6 of Resolution 1676 is intriguing. It indicates a merger involving \"thị trấn Phong Châu,\" along with \"Phú Nham,\" \"Phú Lộc,\" and \"Phù Ninh,\" to form a new \"xã Phù Ninh.\" This is a bit of a curveball since \"Phù Ninh\" is both a district and part of the old address. I *think* what's happening is that the district \"Phù Ninh\" is being reorganized, and its constituent parts are rolled into a new *xã*.\n\nHowever, Line 8 is the key. It definitively states that \"Xã Phú Mỹ,\" along with \"Liên Hoa\" and \"Lệ Mỹ,\" will be merged to form a *new* \"Xã Phú Mỹ.\" Bingo! That seems to be the critical piece of information.  My initial hypothesis is that \"Xã Phú Mỹ\" from the old address will be part of the new \"Xã Phú Mỹ\"\n\nNext, I needed to cross-reference this with the \"New wards\" data.  I was on the lookout for entries matching the newly formed administrative units: \"xã Phù Ninh\" and \"xã Phú Mỹ.\"\n\nThe \"New wards\" list for \"Tỉnh Phú Thọ\" showed:\n*   \"xã Phù Ninh\" with code \"08230\" - matches the resolution!\n*   \"xã Phú Mỹ\" with code \"08236\" - also a match!\n\nThe other entry, \"Phường Phong Châu\", is an old ward, and so not useful for this analysis.\n\nTherefore, my expert opinion is that the old \"Xã Phú Mỹ\" is part of the new \"Xã Phú Mỹ\" with ward code \"08236\". I am confident in my conclusion, given the clear wording of the resolution and the corroborating \"New wards\" data.\n",
