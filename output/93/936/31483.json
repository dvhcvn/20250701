  "thought": "**Analysis of \"Xã Thuận Hưng, Huyện Long Mỹ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\"**\n\nOkay, so I need to find the new administrative unit for \"Xã Thuận Hưng\" in \"Huyện Long Mỹ\", part of the old \"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\".  First, I remember that \"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\" was merged into \"Thành phố Cần Thơ\" – that's crucial.  So, I start looking at resolutions related to Cần Thơ.\n\nI found `1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ`.  I'm scanning through this resolution, specifically looking for \"Thuận Hưng\".  Now, I see two possibilities:\n\n*   **Candidate 1 (High Confidence):** Line 50 of the resolution mentions merging \"Thuận Hưng\", \"Xà Phiên\", and \"Thuận Hòa (huyện Long Mỹ)\". That explicit \"huyện Long Mỹ\" reference is a strong indicator that this \"Thuận Hưng\" is *ours*. This led me to \"Xã Xà Phiên\" in the new wards list, confirmed by code `31495`. So, my top candidate is \"Xã Xà Phiên\" in Cần Thơ.  The resolution line is: \"50. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Thuận Hòa (huyện Long Mỹ), Thuận Hưng và Xà Phiên thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Xà Phiên.\"\n\n*   **Candidate 2 (Low Confidence):** Line 84 also mentions \"Thuận Hưng\" being merged into \"Xã Mỹ Hương\". However, the context is less clear.  It doesn't specify the district, so it's a bit of a wildcard.  This would be \"Xã Mỹ Hương\", with ward code `31591`, but I'm less sure. The line from the resolution is: \"84. Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Thuận Hưng, Phú Mỹ và Mỹ Hương thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Mỹ Hương.\"\n\nTo be thorough, I've constructed my output, including both as potential options, acknowledging the confidence levels I have in each based on the clarity of their source context within the resolution.  It is very likely that \"Xã Xà Phiên\" is the more definitive choice.\n",

I need to first consider province changes.\\\\n\\\\n**Province Merger Impact:**\\\\n\\\\nMy initial thought is to check if Tỉnh Hậu Giang was merged. Bingo! Resolution 60-NQ/TW tells me Hậu Giang is now part of \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\". That narrows the search immediately.

I found several in Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Cần Thơ.\\\\n\\\\n*   The first mention is a \\\\\\\"phường Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\", but the original input specifies a \\\\\\\"xã\\\\\\\". This seems less likely to be the right unit. However, I kept it as a possibility in case the hierarchy changed.\\\\n*   Another section mentions \\\\\\\"thị xã Long Mỹ\\\\\\\" but not \\\\\\\"Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\".\\\\n*   Then I hit paydirt!  Section 50 states, \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Thuận Hòa (huyện Long Mỹ), Thuận Hưng và Xà Phiên thành xã mới có tên gọi là xã Xà Phiên.\\\\\\\"  This is a significant clue. It states that \\\\\\\"Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\" *and* \\\\\\\"huyện Long Mỹ\\\\\\\" are mentioned in the same context, along with \\\\\\\"xã Xà Phiên.\\\\\\\" The implication is that \\\\\\\"Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\" has merged with another unit to form the new \\\\\\\"xã Xà Phiên\\\\\\\".  This aligns perfectly with my initial analysis. I'm going with **xã Xà Phiên** as the likely answer.\\\\n* Section 84 mentions 'xã Thuận Hưng' and states that is merged into the new 'xã Mỹ Hương.'\\\\n\\\\nBased on this comprehensive analysis, my confident conclusion is that \\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Hưng, Huyện Long Mỹ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" is now part of **xã Xà Phiên, Thành phố Cần Thơ**.

I immediately go to my mental map of province mergers and pull up Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Ah yes, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hậu Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to become just \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

I'm looking at Resolution `1668/NQ-UBTVQH15`, and specifically focused on how \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Long Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was affected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nScanning through, I see a few \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mentions. But, the original address is a xã, so those aren't relevant. Finally, I get to Line 50. Bingo! It mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Hưng (huyện Long Mỹ)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"! It indicates that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", along with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thuận Hòa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xà Phiên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will become a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xà Phiên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  This is looking very good, and it aligns with my expectation. Just to be sure, I review Line 84 as well, but this one does the opposite with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWith the province being Thành phố Cần Thơ, my conclusion is clear: the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Hưng, Huyện Long Mỹ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now **Xã Xà Phiên** in **Thành phố Cần Thơ**.

I'm carefully reviewing the lines of the resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTwo potential scenarios are emerging. Line 50 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"huyện Long Mỹ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the original district. It also mentions a new ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Xà Phiên.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Line 84 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a new ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Mỹ Hương,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but doesn't mention Long Mỹ. This makes me suspect Xà Phiên is the most likely candidate. I'm going to flag that as higher confidence based on the more specific information.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI'm confirming this by cross-referencing against the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data. The data confirms the province is indeed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for both potential results.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, for the JSON output, I'll provide details for two possibilities.

For \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Mỹ Hương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", citing resolution line 84, I'll indicate \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" confidence due to the missing district information.

I'll search for the wards I found above - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xà Phiên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Hương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", to see which one, if either, exists.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSure enough, I find \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xà Phiên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with the correct data, province and ward codes: `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"31495\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xà Phiên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}` and also \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Hương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"31591\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Hương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`. Since both exists and match the province, I'll need to output both.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBased on the information, I'm going to construct my JSON output. The fact that the first one explicitly mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thuận Hưng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" AND \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Long Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" increases my confidence. So, while both are options, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xà Phiên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a *high-confidence* match, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Hương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *low confidence* with the information provided. I'll flag the JSON objects accordingly.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất thành phố cần Thơ, tỉnh Sóc Trăng và tỉnh Hậu Giang; lấy tên là thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"31495\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xà Phiên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Hợp nhất thành phố cần Thơ, tỉnh Sóc Trăng và tỉnh Hậu Giang; lấy tên là thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"31591\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Mỹ Hương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
