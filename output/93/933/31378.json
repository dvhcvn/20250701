The task is to find the current administrative unit corresponding to the old \"Xã Phú Hữu, Huyện Châu Thành, Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\"  First, I need to account for the fact that \"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\" was merged into \"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\"  That immediately shifts my focus to resolutions regarding Cần Thơ's administrative changes.\n\nI've zeroed in on Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, \"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ.\"  Within that, I found two potential matches for \"Xã Phú Hữu.\"\n\nThe first, from Line 57, describes merging \"Phú Tân,\" \"Đông Phước,\" and \"Phú Hữu\" into a new \"Xã Phú Hữu.\"  This strongly suggests a connection, but it's crucial to acknowledge the lack of district-level specificity. There's an existing \"Xã Phú Hữu\" in Cần Thơ, and this *could* be the one, but the lack of district information from the resolution makes it less certain.\n\nThen, Line 69 mentions merging \"Hậu Thạnh,\" \"Phú Hữu,\" and \"Trường Khánh\" into a new \"Xã Trường Khánh.\" Again, no district-level context is provided.\n\nSince both scenarios are plausible, and the original \"Huyện Châu Thành\" isn't explicitly mentioned, I can't definitively determine which resolution applies to the original \"Xã Phú Hữu, Huyện Châu Thành.\" The Vietnamese administrative landscape can have multiple localities with the same name, hence the need for province, district, and sometimes commune.\n\nI've examined other resolutions (1654, 1662, 1663, 1685) but they pertain to other provinces and aren't relevant.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate course of action is to present both possibilities:\n\n1.  **\"Xã Phú Hữu\"** (ward code: 31378, Thành phố Cần Thơ) - from line 57 of 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15. My confidence here is \"low\" because of the district ambiguity.\n\n2.  **\"Xã Trường Khánh\"** (ward code: 31654, Thành phố Cần Thơ) - from line 69 of 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15. My confidence is also \"low\".\n\nBoth are valid candidates, and both need to be considered. The output should be a JSON array containing these two possible new ward names, each with \"low\" confidence due to the information constraints from the cited resolution.\n",

I need to figure out the new administrative unit for the old ward \\\"Xã Phú Hữu\\\" in \\\"Huyện Châu Thành, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\".  First, I need to understand what's happened to that region.  Given my knowledge of the recent administrative changes in the Mekong Delta, I know the first step is to check for province-level mergers and adjustments.\\n\\nI remember reading about Resolution 60-NQ/TW, which dissolved the old province of Hậu Giang and merged it, along with Sóc Trăng, into Cần Thơ.

I need to go back and cross-reference, considering the \\\"Huyện Châu Thành\\\" aspect of the original location.

The user's query (\\\\\\\"Xã Phú Hữu, Huyện Châu Thành, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\") presents an interesting challenge, given the recent administrative changes in Vietnam. My task is to pinpoint the *exact* new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Hữu\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nFirst things first, I immediately recognize that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" is no longer a standalone province. According to Resolution 60-NQ/TW, it was merged with Cần Thơ and Sóc Trăng, now becoming \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\" So, that's step one: the new province is Cần Thơ.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the real work begins. I've got to comb through the relevant resolutions, particularly those concerning \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\" (formerly Hậu Giang), looking for any mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Hữu.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe key resolution here is \\\\\\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\"  This is where the magic happens (or, rather, the mapping).\\\\n\\\\nLine 57 of this resolution immediately catches my eye: it states that \\\\\\\"các xã Phú Tân, Đông Phước và Phú Hữu\\\\\\\" are *combined* to form a *new* \\\\\\\"xã Phú Hữu.\\\\\\\" This directly addresses the \\\\\\\"Phú Hữu\\\\\\\" element in the old address. Perfect, right?  Not quite.\\\\n\\\\nFurther down, line 69 throws a wrench into the works. It indicates that \\\\\\\"các xã Hậu Thạnh, Phú Hữu và Trường Khánh\\\\\\\" are being merged to create the *new* \\\\\\\"xã Trường Khánh.\\\\\\\"  See the problem?  The old \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Hữu\\\\\\\" could potentially be part of *either* the new \\\\\\\"xã Phú Hữu\\\\\\\" *or* the new \\\\\\\"xã Trường Khánh.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis presents a clear ambiguity. The resolution details these mergers, but it's not immediately apparent *which* specific \\\\\\\"Xã Phú Hữu\\\\\\\" from the old address is now a component of the new \\\\\\\"xã Phú Hữu\\\\\\\" and which is now part of \\\\\\\"xã Trường Khánh\\\\\\\".  Further investigation might be needed to provide a definitive answer.
