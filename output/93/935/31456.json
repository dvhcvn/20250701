  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit for Xã Vĩnh Trung**\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out what happened to \"Xã Vĩnh Trung, Huyện Vị Thuỷ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\" First, a quick recap: old ward is Xã Vĩnh Trung, district is Huyện Vị Thuỷ, and the province is Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\n\nSince provinces often get reorganized, I started with the big picture.  I remembered that Hậu Giang was merged.  A quick check of the relevant resolutions (60-NQ/TW) confirmed it: Hậu Giang became part of \"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\"  So, any new ward information would have to be within the context of Cần Thơ.\n\nNow, I had to dig through the specific resolutions to find any mentions of \"Xã Vĩnh Trung\" within Cần Thơ. I started with the most recent resolutions, looking for ward-level changes. I methodically went through each relevant resolution: 1654, 1662, 1667, and finally, 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15.\n\n1654 (An Giang) was a no-go, wrong province. 1662 (Đồng Nai) was silent. 1667 (Khánh Hòa) also had a \"Vĩnh Trung,\" but that was in Khánh Hòa, not Cần Thơ.\n\nFinally, 1668 (Cần Thơ) showed promise. I carefully scanned each line. Line 45 mentioned \"Vị Trung,\" but that wasn't \"Vĩnh Trung.\" Line 46 had no relevant information. Then, there it was: Line 48. Bingo! It explicitly stated that \"Xã Vĩnh Trung\" was merged into a new ward called \"Xã Vĩnh Tường.\"  The resolution number is 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 48.\n\nTherefore, \"Xã Vĩnh Trung, Huyện Vị Thuỷ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\" is now part of \"Xã Vĩnh Tường\" in \"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\"  Problem solved.\n",

The user's looking for the current administrative unit corresponding to \\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung, Huyện Vị Thuỷ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\". My first thought is, this is a bit of a historical puzzle, since we're dealing with past provinces and current configurations.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" as the starting point. Quick check: I know from previous experience that Hậu Giang merged, and that was confirmed. Specifically, it became part of \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\" – the old province is now part of a bigger picture. That's step one, a crucial adjustment to our framework.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I zeroed in on \\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung.\\\\\\\" Time to look for relevant resolutions within the new \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\" framework, since the old province doesn't exist anymore.  I quickly landed on Resolution \\\\\\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15,\\\\\\\" which is exactly what I need: it's all about administrative restructuring within Cần Thơ.\\\\n\\\\nHere's where it gets interesting, and frankly, a little murky. Line 45 indicates \\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung\\\\\\\" merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Vị Thủy,\\\\\\\" and line 48 says it merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Tường.\\\\\\\"  *Two* different possibilities! My initial assessment? This smells like a potential conflict. It could be a simple data error, or maybe \\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung\\\\\\\" is a name used for different wards in different districts or administrative contexts (which isn't unusual in Vietnam). Regardless, I've got to investigate both possibilities since the prompt asks for \\\\\\\"all possible new ward candidates,\\\\\\\" and I'm unsure.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the district in the original address (\\\\\\\"Huyện Vị Thuỷ\\\\\\\"), I gave each of the merge scenarios a more in-depth look. Since \\\\\\\"thị trấn Nàng Mau\\\\\\\" (capital of Huyện Vị Thủy) and \\\\\\\"Xã Vị Thắng\\\\\\\" are mentioned in line 45 along with one of the \\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung\\\\\\\" usages, \\\\\\\"Xã Vị Thủy\\\\\\\" is the more likely candidate (line 45 is the stronger option). I also checked to see if the second, more vague option, \\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Tường,\\\\\\\" could be a possible match. That said, with no districts mentioned in line 48, I think this could go either way.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, I cross-referenced these potential new wards with the provided data. \\\\\\\"Xã Vị Thủy\\\\\\\" corresponds to the code \\\\\\\"31441,\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Tường\\\\\\\" to \\\\\\\"31459\\\\\\\" – both in \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\" Given the ambiguity, I'd say both are plausible, with a slightly higher confidence in \\\\\\\"Xã Vị Thủy\\\\\\\" due to its explicit association with \\\\\\\"Huyện Vị Thuỷ\\\\\\\" in the cited resolution. However, given the nature of the prompt, I'd need to consider both.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất thành phố cần Thơ, tỉnh Sóc Trăng và tỉnh Hậu Giang; lấy tên là thành phố Cần Thơ\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"high\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"31441\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Vị Thủy\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"45.

The user needs the updated administrative unit for the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung, Huyện Vị Thuỷ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  My first step, as always, is to pinpoint the original province, which is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  \\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nKnowing my territory, I immediately recalled the province resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW, regarding administrative reorganizations.  A quick check confirmed my suspicion: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was absorbed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This simplifies the search.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the focus shifts to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I know that sometimes administrative units retain their names, sometimes they merge, and sometimes they split. So I went looking through resolutions relevant to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and, by extension, those concerning the former \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I zeroed in on Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning the restructuring of wards in Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 45 of that resolution caught my eye: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của thị trấn Nàng Mau, xã Vị Thắng và xã Vị Trung thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Vị Thủy**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This certainly contains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, I continued my investigation. Line 48 also contains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Vĩnh Trung và xã Vĩnh Tường thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Vĩnh Tường**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is where things get interesting. I'm faced with a potential conflict: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is involved in two separate merges, leading to two distinct new wards, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vị Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vĩnh Tường.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This could indicate an error in the data or that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" refers to distinct wards with the same name. Since the original address mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Vị Thuỷ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", I reviewed the context of each line.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking closer at line 45, I noted that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Nàng Mau\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the capital of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Vị Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Hậu Giang). This strongly suggests that this merge and new ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vị Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", are within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Vị Thuỷ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Line 48, though, doesn't provide district context, which further muddles the situation. Given the lack of certainty, and since the prompt asks for *all* possible matches, I'm compelled to list both possibilities. Because both scenarios mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Vĩnh Trung\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the context of the Cần Thơ province (which includes former Hậu Giang), both new wards, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vị Thủy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Vĩnh Tường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", are plausible and are the best candidates.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFinally, I cross-referenced these potential new wards with the provided \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.
