  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit for Xã Long Phú**\n\nOkay, here's the deal: I'm trying to figure out what happened to \"Xã Long Phú, Thị xã Long Mỹ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\" First, I know that \"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\" merged into \"Thành phố Cần Thơ\" – that's settled by Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Now, I need to check Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one about restructuring wards in Cần Thơ.\n\nI scanned the resolution and found two potential matches: line 20 mentions \"xã Long Phú\" being reorganized into \"**phường Long Phú 1**,\" and line 72 merges \"thị trấn Long Phú\" and \"xã Long Phú\" to form a new \"**xã Long Phú**.\" The problem is, neither line specifically links that \"xã Long Phú\" to the \"Thị xã Long Mỹ\" I started with.\n\nWhile the resolution *does* contain mentions of units from \"Thị xã Long Mỹ,\" like \"phường Thuận An,\" it doesn't confirm these specific two *phường* and *xã* names are of from the Thị xã. It's possible that there were other \"Xã Long Phú\" units from other merged provinces, like \"Huyện Long Phú,\" which is now a part of \"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\"\n\nBoth the new unit \"phường Long Phú 1\" and the new unit \"xã Long Phú\" appear in the list of new wards for \"Thành phố Cần Thơ\" with codes 31480 and 31639, respectively.\n\nSince I can't definitively connect the original \"Xã Long Phú\" from \"Thị xã Long Mỹ\" to either \"phường Long Phú 1\" or \"xã Long Phú\" in the resolution with certainty, I'll have to present both options with low confidence:\n*   **\"Phường Long Phú 1\" (31480):** Cited from line 20.\n*   **\"Xã Long Phú\" (31639):** Cited from line 72.\n\nI need to flag this ambiguity, but this is the best I can do with the available information.\n",

I need to figure out the current designation for \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú, Thị xã Long Mỹ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I break it down: Ward is \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú,\\\\\\\" District is \\\\\\\"Thị xã Long Mỹ,\\\\\\\" and Province is \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\\\\\\\"  Easy enough.  Now, the province is a key to start with. I know I have to check for any province mergers, and the 60-NQ/TW Resolution is usually the place to start.  Ah, yes,  \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" was merged with \\\\\\\"Sóc Trăng\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\"  So, that takes care of the province.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I need to look for changes at the ward level and search for both \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Thị xã Long Mỹ.\\\\\\\"  The relevant resolution is 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15 concerning ward-level changes in the new \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\"  I skim through it.\\\\n\\\\nThere are some interesting rules there:\\\\n\\\\n*   One talks about \\\\\\\"phường Thuận An (thị xã Long Mỹ)\\\\\\\" forming \\\\\\\"phường Long Mỹ.\\\\\\\" That’s related to my input, but not exactly it.\\\\n*   Another mentions \\\\\\\"phường Trà Lồng, xã Tân Phú và xã Long Phú\\\\\\\" becoming \\\\\\\"phường Long Phú 1.\\\\\\\" Bingo!\\\\n*   There's also another rule mentioning \\\\\\\"xã Long Phú,\\\\\\\" but with \\\\\\\"thị trấn Long Phú\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\"xã Long Phú.\\\\\\\" Another potential hit!\\\\n\\\\nSo, the old \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\".  And \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\" is mentioned in two separate mergers. I need to be precise.  \\\\n\\\\nThe input address specified \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú, **Thị xã Long Mỹ**.\\\\\\\" I go back and scrutinize the text. I realize that the two instances of \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\" might refer to places in different districts.\\\\n\\\\nTo solve this, I will check the new wards list to pinpoint the correct administrative unit.  I find the following:\\\\n\\\\n*   \\\\\\\"Phường Long Phú 1\\\\\\\" - corresponds to Rule 20.\\\\n*   \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\" - corresponds to Rule 72.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the old \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\" from the address \\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú, Thị xã Long Mỹ, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" is now part of **\\\\\\\"Phường Long Phú 1\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\"**.

I've got to dig into the resolutions related to this area, specifically Resolution \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the tricky part: I found *two* lines that mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". One (Line 20) talks about merging it with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Trà Lồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to create \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Long Phú 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The other (Line 72) merges it with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form... well, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Long Phú.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis is throwing me a curveball. It *seems* like there were possibly two distinct \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" entities in the old system, or there's some ambiguity in how these merges were described. I have to be absolutely certain which \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the user is referring to given the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Long Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" context.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 20 strongly suggests that one \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has become \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Long Phú 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so I need to clarify that this is distinct from line 72 and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".

My first thought is, let's break this down. The first thing I need to do is update the province.  From the resolutions, particularly *60-NQ/TW*, it's clear that Hậu Giang has been merged into Cần Thơ. So, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm looking for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the context of Cần Thơ's recent administrative changes. I've got to dig into the resolutions related to the restructuring.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI found resolution *1668/NQ-UBTVQH15* and quickly zeroed in on lines 20 and 72. Line 20 indicates that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Long Phú,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *along with* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Trà Lồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" form a new *phường* called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Long Phú 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Great, that's one strong possibility.  Line 72, however, is a bit confusing because it talks about a merger of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", resulting in another new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Wait... does this mean there are two places called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" initially? Or is there an error in the resolutions? Given the original address including \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Long Mỹ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I suspect I should pay closer attention to the formation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Long Phú 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as it involves \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Long Mỹ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI'll need to double-check this. It looks like \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been incorporated into two new administrative units: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Long Phú 1\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Long Phú\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I'll need to figure out which is correct, or if both are somehow relevant, to provide the accurate updated administrative unit. The ambiguity requires closer inspection of any other pertinent resolutions and perhaps some cross-referencing to be certain.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"20.
