  "thought": "**Analyzing the Reorganization of Xã Tân Bình**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to pinpoint the current administrative unit for the old ward \"Xã Tân Bình, Huyện Phụng Hiệp, Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\"  First, I need to understand the historical context. \"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\" has been absorbed into \"Thành phố Cần Thơ\" as per Resolution 60-NQ/TW. So, we're now operating within the \"Thành phố Cần Thơ\" framework.\n\nNext, I turned my attention to Resolution 1668/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key document for administrative changes in \"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\"  Line 58 of this resolution immediately grabbed my attention:  `Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Bình Thành và xã Tân Bình thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tân Bình**.`  This suggests a direct connection – a \"xã Tân Bình\" is being formed.  The old ward name matches perfectly, which is a strong indicator.\n\nHowever, the resolution doesn't explicitly state the district. The old ward was in \"Huyện Phụng Hiệp\", but that's not directly addressed here.  Line 63 talks about merging \"xã Hòa Mỹ\" and \"xã Phụng Hiệp\" but it's less relevant to my specific query.\n\nSince the province has changed and the resolution aligns, I investigated the \"New wards\" list for this new ward. I found a match: `{\"ward_code\":\"31399\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Tân Bình\",\"province_name\":\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\"}`. This confirms the new \"Xã Tân Bình\" within the correct province.\n\nConsidering the provincial changes and the clear reference to a new \"Xã Tân Bình\" in the resolution, I'm confident that this is the correct match. The lack of district specification in the resolution doesn't significantly weaken the connection given that the ward and province match perfectly within a resolution detailing administrative restructuring.  Thus, my final answer is \"Xã Tân Bình\", now under \"Thành phố Cần Thơ,\" with a high degree of confidence.\n",

The initial task is to pin down the current administrative unit for this address. I started by breaking it down: \\\"Xã Tân Bình\\\" (Ward), \\\"Huyện Phụng Hiệp\\\" (District), and \\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\" (Province).  We all know about the province mergers, so the first step was to check if \\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\" had been absorbed. Sure enough, Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that it's now part of \\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\"\\n\\nNow, I needed to check if any of the resolutions had re-mapped \\\"Xã Tân Bình\\\" or \\\"Huyện Phụng Hiệp\\\" within \\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\"  I went through the listed resolutions, looking for any mentions of \\\"Tân Bình,\\\" \\\"Phụng Hiệp,\\\" or \\\"Cần Thơ.\\\"  I quickly dismissed most of them as irrelevant.\\n\\nThe key was Resolution `1668/NQ-UBTVQH15` regarding \\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\".  Line 58 mentions a merger of \\\"xã Bình Thành\\\" and \\\"xã Tân Bình\\\" into a *new* \\\"xã Tân Bình.\\\" While that's promising, it doesn't immediately clarify the district.  Line 63 talks about merging \\\"xã Hòa Mỹ\\\" and \\\"xã Phụng Hiệp\\\" into a new \\\"xã Phụng Hiệp,\\\" which strongly suggests some reorganization of the old \\\"Huyện Phụng Hiệp\\\".\\n\\nConsidering the original address, with both ward and district included, and the fact that a *new* \\\"xã Tân Bình\\\" appears in the resolution, I'm confident that this is the correct entry for the ward. Also, line 63 confirms that the district \\\"Phụng Hiệp\\\" is still relevant, although possibly reorganized.  I would need further research to confirm the specific boundaries or if the district name has changed at all. But, I think this is a pretty solid lead. It's likely that our original \\\"Xã Tân Bình, Huyện Phụng Hiệp\\\" is now part of the new administrative structure of Cần Thơ, specifically with the new \\\"xã Tân Bình\\\" resulting from the merger.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ\",\n        \"line\": \"58.

The \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\" resolution clearly states that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" merged into \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\" So, step one, the new province is Cần Thơ.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the real challenge. I need to figure out what happened to \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình, Huyện Phụng Hiệp\\\\\\\" within this Cần Thơ context.  I'm digging through other relevant resolutions, specifically looking for mentions of \\\\\\\"Tân Bình\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Phụng Hiệp\\\\\\\" now that they're part of Cần Thơ.\\\\n\\\\nI found resolution \\\\\\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15,\\\\\\\" which specifically addresses administrative changes within Cần Thơ.  Resolution 58 is promising: it discusses merging \\\\\\\"xã Bình Thành\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\" into a *new* \\\\\\\"xã Tân Bình.\\\\\\\"  The fact that it is within the Cần Thơ resolution is a good sign. Moreover, Resolution 63 in the same document mentions the merging of \\\\\\\"xã Hòa Mỹ\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"xã Phụng Hiệp\\\\\\\" which further strengthens the possibility.\\\\n\\\\nThe resolution mentions \\\\\\\"xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\" but the specifics are hazy. Specifically,  it doesn't explicitly tie it back to the \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình, Huyện Phụng Hiệp, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" I started with.  This is a bit of a wrinkle. I'm now cross-referencing this information with my \\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\" list. I see an entry: `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"31399\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\"}`. That's a perfect match for the new ward and province.\\\\n\\\\nSo, how confident am I? Well, the province change is rock solid. The Cần Thơ resolution is targeted to Cần Thơ.  The resolution 58 speaks of a merger creating \\\\\\\"xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\". This is *highly* suggestive, even if it's not absolutely conclusive. The lack of an explicit district mention for the *old* \\\\\\\"xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\" leaves some room for doubt, but given the merged province and the Cần Thơ-specific resolution, I'd say this is the most likely scenario. It would have been better if the resolution included the original district as well, but based on the available information, it appears that the \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình, Huyện Phụng Hiệp, Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\" is now part of the new \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất thành phố cần Thơ, tỉnh Sóc Trăng và tỉnh Hậu Giang; lấy tên là thành phố Cần Thơ\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"high\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"31399\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Tân Bình\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"58.

The user's query asks about the new administrative unit for the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình, Huyện Phụng Hiệp, Tỉnh Hậu Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My initial focus is on the provincial merger since Hậu Giang is involved. Checking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I confirmed the expected: Hậu Giang merged into Cần Thơ. So, the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Hậu Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the challenge is finding where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình, Huyện Phụng Hiệp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" fits in this new Cần Thơ structure.  I looked at relevant resolutions and found \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This resolution focuses on Cần Thơ, which is key.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 58 of that document mentions a merger forming a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Bình.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  Crucially, it **doesn't** specify the district. This is a bit of a gray area. But, this is the most promising lead. Line 63 in the same resolution mentions the *same* district, confirming that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phụng Hiệp\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is within Cần Thơ's scope.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy current hypothesis is that the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" mentioned in line 58 is indeed the one from Huyện Phụng Hiệp, given that this resolution applies to all former Hậu Giang areas now within Cần Thơ. This is the only place it would make sense.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI cross-referenced this with a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list and found a match: `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"31399\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`. This supports the initial hypothesis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nConfidence is high in the overall solution (province), but line 58’s ambiguity slightly tempers my certainty regarding the precise locality of the new ward. The fact that the same resolution mentions another ward from Phụng Hiệp within Cần Thơ reinforces my belief that it’s the correct match. However, I’ll keep in mind that there *could* be other \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wards and refine my logic if conflicting evidence emerges.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất thành phố cần Thơ, tỉnh Sóc Trăng và tỉnh Hậu Giang; lấy tên là thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"31399\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Bình\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1668/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Cần Thơ\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"58.
