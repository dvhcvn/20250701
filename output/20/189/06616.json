  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got to work with. The user needs me to figure out the new location of \"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình, Huyện Đình Lập, Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\" based on some resolutions and the available new ward data.  I immediately recognize this will require careful analysis of the provided resolutions and their relationship to the old and new administrative units.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the lay of the land. We have two key resolutions: `60-NQ/TW`, which deals with province-level changes, and `1672/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which is about changes at the commune/ward level *in* Lạng Sơn province. I see \"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\" is in the Lạng Sơn province, and the database gives us the potential location of the new unit called \"Xã Đình Lập\".\n\nI start by checking the province-level changes. Resolution `60-NQ/TW` specifically lists \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\" as *not* being merged or reorganized at the province level. So, the province name remains the same.  Good, one piece of the puzzle.  Now, the user has mentioned that the \"Vietnamese government has issued resolutions that restructure administrative units, eliminating all districts.\" So, I need to check if the district of \"Huyện Đình Lập\" is eliminated in the provided resolutions.\n\nNow I delve into the more complex commune/ward level changes described in `1672/NQ-UBTVQH15`. The resolution explicitly merges certain communes and wards in Lạng Sơn, including \"thị trấn Đình Lập\" and \"xã Đình Lập\", into a new \"xã Đình Lập\".  But here's the rub: \"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\" isn't *directly* mentioned in the resolution. It's a key detail to note; the specific old ward I'm after is missing. I need to acknowledge that the given information doesn't explicitly link \"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\" to any new specific unit. However, I can infer that the old district \"Huyện Đình Lập\" has been eliminated and a new \"xã Đình Lập\" has taken its place, according to the resolutions. I also understand that \"NT\" likely stands for \"Nông trường\" (State Farm).\n\nGiven the absence of a direct mention of \"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\", I am not sure of the new location. The database has \"Xã Đình Lập\", but I can't confirm that \"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\" became a part of it. I have to indicate that my confidence is low, and that there are insufficient details to provide a definite mapping. It seems the best answer is an empty array because of the missing information.\n",

The user needs an old Vietnamese address translated to a new one, and I've got a lot to unpack here. The old address is `Thị trấn NT Thái Bình, Huyện Đình Lập, Tỉnh Lạng Sơn`. I see the key components: the ward (`Thị trấn NT Thái Bình`), the district (`Huyện Đình Lập`), and the province (`Tỉnh Lạng Sơn`).\\n\\nFirst, I need to check the province-level context (`60-NQ/TW`). It's important to know if Lạng Sơn was merged or not. Good news: it wasn't. So, for now, the province name, `Tỉnh Lạng Sơn`, is solid.\\n\\nNow, I'm focusing on the district and ward level, specifically resolution `1672/NQ-UBTVQH15`. This is where it gets interesting. This resolution is all about Lạng Sơn and specifically restructuring things within Đình Lập district. It mentions the old units like `thị trấn Đình Lập`, `xã Đình Lập`, and `xã Bính Xá`.  Then there's the outcome.  All of that is rolled up into a new `Xã Đình Lập`. That's significant.\\n\\nHere's the problem: The old address mentions `Thị trấn NT Thái Bình`. That's a *nông trường* (state farm). The resolution mentions `thị trấn Đình Lập`, but not `Thị trấn NT Thái Bình` directly. It's a bit of a wrinkle. I've got to consider if `Thị trấn NT Thái Bình` was also involved in the district's reshuffling, even if it's not specifically stated.\\n\\nSo, I'll search the list of new wards. I found `Xã Đình Lập` with code `06613` that fits the resolution. That new ward is a direct result of that merger. The old ward of `Thị trấn NT Thái Bình` might have been impacted but there is no confirmed mapping yet.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình, Huyện Đình Lập, Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 7584,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0031160999999999997,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Analysis of Address Mapping for \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\\\\\\\"**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, here's how I'm approaching this: I need to determine the new administrative unit corresponding to the old address \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình, Huyện Đình Lập, Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the components: old ward (\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\\\\\\\"), old district (\\\\\\\"Huyện Đình Lập\\\\\\\"), and old province (\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\\\\\\\").  I immediately confirmed that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\\\\\\\" remains unchanged based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW.\\\\n\\\\nThen, I focused on the relevant resolution, 1672/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning administrative unit rearrangement in Lạng Sơn Province.  Line 40 of this resolution outlines the merging of \\\\\\\"thị trấn Đình Lập,\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\"xã Đình Lập,\\\\\\\" and parts of \\\\\\\"xã Bính Xá\\\\\\\" into the new \\\\\\\"xã Đình Lập.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe challenge here is that \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned as one of the contributing entities in this merger.  I know that the target new ward provided is \\\\\\\"Xã Đình Lập\\\\\\\" with code \\\\\\\"06613\\\\\\\".  While \\\\\\\"Huyện Đình Lập\\\\\\\" is involved, the resolution doesn't give a clear indication that \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\\\\\\\" became part of this new \\\\\\\"Xã Đình Lập\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nGiven that the direct mapping is missing, my confidence is low.  I can't say with certainty that \\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\\\\\\\" now belongs to \\\\\\\"Xã Đình Lập\\\\\\\" based solely on the available information.  It's possible it's involved in some other adjustment not covered by this resolution.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the output I'll construct will reflect this uncertainty: I'll include the new ward's information (`ward_code`: \\\\\\\"06613\\\\\\\", `ward_name`: \\\\\\\"Xã Đình Lập\\\\\\\", `province_name`: \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\\\\\\\") along with \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\" confidence and cite the relevant line (line 40) of resolution 1672/NQ-UBTVQH15.

I've been given an old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình, Huyện Đình Lập, Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and need to map it to a new administrative unit.

Then, I dug into resolution 1672/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically focusing on its impact on the province. This resolution describes the merging of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Đình Lập\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Đình Lập\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bính Xá\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into a new ward: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Đình Lập\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe challenge here lies in directly mapping the old ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn NT Thái Bình\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to this new ward.
