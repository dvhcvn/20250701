  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Hòa Bình, Huyện Văn Quan, Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been asked to find the new administrative unit for that old address. First things first, I need to check for province mergers. The user is asking about Lạng Sơn. Looking at Resolution 60-NQ/TW, it confirms that Lạng Sơn hasn't been merged. Good. That simplifies things.\n\nNow, the real work begins: finding \"Xã Hòa Bình\" within \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn\" and \"Huyện Văn Quan.\" I'm diving into the relevant resolutions, specifically `1672/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which deals with administrative rearrangement in Lạng Sơn. I'm carefully scanning it, looking for any mention of the ward in question.\n\nMy attention immediately goes to line 15, but that refers to a Hòa Bình in Bình Gia district, which isn't the one I'm looking for. Moving on. Ah! Line 22... that's it! It mentions Hòa Bình in Văn Quan district, along with a merger with Tú Xuyên and Văn Quan town into a new ward called **xã Văn Quan**. Excellent, I've got my match!\n\nJust to be thorough, I quickly glance at lines 49 and 57, but those are Hòa Bình wards in Hữu Lũng and Chi Lăng districts, which are irrelevant. So, I'm confident in my finding. Now I need to extract the new ward name and code. I'll search the \"New wards\" list for \"Xã Văn Quan\" in \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn.\" Found it! The code is \"06253\".\n\nFinally, time to construct the output. I'll include the citation information: the resolution number, `1672/NQ-UBTVQH15`, and the relevant line, which confirms that Hòa Bình (Văn Quan) is now part of xã Văn Quan. My confidence level is high because this is a direct match, and the resolution clearly spells it out. The province name, of course, remains \"Tỉnh Lạng Sơn,\" and I've got the new ward code, \"06253,\" and ward name, \"Xã Văn Quan.\" I think I've successfully resolved the user's request.\n",
