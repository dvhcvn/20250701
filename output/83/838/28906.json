  "thought": "**Determining the New Ward for the Given Address**\n\nOkay, I'm facing a request to identify the new administrative ward for the address \"Xã Thanh Tân, Huyện Mỏ Cày Bắc, Tỉnh Bến Tre\".  My approach is straightforward: I need to pinpoint any changes in administrative units, specifically focusing on ward (xã) level alterations.\n\nFirst, I identified \"Tỉnh Bến Tre\" (Bến Tre Province) as the old province. Now, the crucial step is to determine if this province has been subject to any mergers or name changes.  I recall checking the province resolutions (60-NQ/TW) where it's mentioned that Bến Tre, Vĩnh Long, and Trà Vinh were merged to become \"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long.\" This means I need to look for any information within resolutions related to either the old name or the new, merged province.\n\nMy next step involves meticulously scanning \"Other resolutions\" for any mention of the old ward name, \"Thanh Tân\", coupled with either the old or new province name. I'm focusing on the `lines` of each resolution to detect \"Thanh Tân\" and comparing it to the province in the `header` of each resolution.\n\nI've been going through the provided resolutions, but so far, I've noticed that most of the resolutions aren't relevant since they pertain to different provinces: Đồng Nai, Đồng Tháp, Hưng Yên, Cần Thơ, Hải Phòng, Lạng Sơn, Ninh Bình, Nghệ An, Tây Ninh, Thái Nguyên, and Thanh Hóa.\n\nThe resolution **1666/NQ-UBTVQH15** (Hưng Yên province) mentions a \"Thanh Tân\", but it's part of a consolidation to form a new ward named \"Bình Nguyên.\" This is in a different province, so it's not the one I'm looking for.\n\nLikewise, **1669/NQ-UBTVQH15** (Hải Phòng province) also shows a \"Thanh Tân\" but consolidated with other wards to become \"Thanh Hà.\" This resolution is also not applicable.\n\n**1674/NQ-UBTVQH15** (Ninh Bình province) shows another \"Thanh Tân\" merged into \"Thanh Lâm\". Not relevant either.\n\nFinally, in **1686/NQ-UBTVQH15** (Thanh Hóa province), I found another instance where a part of the \"Thanh Tân\" ward is merged into \"Công Chính\". This one is also in a different province.\n\nSo far, none of these resolutions have addressed the ward in the original address. I need to keep looking, but this is the systematic process I'm following to find the relevant information. It looks like the relevant resolution isn't included in the provided text.\n",
