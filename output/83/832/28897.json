  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Vĩnh Hòa, Huyện Chợ Lách, Tỉnh Bến Tre\"**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with finding the new administrative unit for that old address. The first thing I need to do is confirm the province, \"Tỉnh Bến Tre\".  I know these administrative adjustments can be a bit tricky, especially after mergers. My approach is to follow these steps:\n1.  **Province Identification:** First, I confirm the old province is indeed \"Tỉnh Bến Tre\".\n2.  **Province Merger Check:** I recall there have been some recent adjustments. I need to consult the resolutions like 60-NQ/TW to see if \"Tỉnh Bến Tre\" has undergone any changes. Aha!  According to the resolution, Bến Tre, Vĩnh Long, and Tra Vinh were merged into Vĩnh Long. So, now the relevant province is Vĩnh Long, but since this case likely predates the resolution, I'll need to double-check within the resolutions and consider the old province in the event the resolution was predated.\n3.  **Resolution Analysis:** This is the core part. I need to thoroughly examine the provided resolutions, focusing on those about \"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh X\". The key is finding mention of \"Xã Vĩnh Hòa\" within these resolutions.  I'm primarily looking for how it's been rearranged, but I need to be sure the resolutions being checked include those that would have been relevant pre-merger.\n\nI begin by systematically reviewing the resolutions:\n\n*   **1654/NQ-UBTVQH15 (An Giang):** I quickly scan for relevant \"Xã Vĩnh Hòa\" mentions, but it looks like all the instances here are in reference to An Giang, and none in Bến Tre.\n*   **1664/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Gia Lai):**  Again, nothing related to Bến Tre or Vĩnh Hòa in the specific format I am looking for.  The Vĩnh Hòa in this resolution is tied to Gia Lai.\n*   **1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Khánh Hòa):** More of the same, with this \"Vĩnh Hòa\" belonging to Khánh Hòa.\n*   **1669/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Hải Phòng):** Again, relevant mention of Vĩnh Hòa, but it is in reference to a completely different location, Hải Phòng.\n*   **1680/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Quảng Trị):** I search this resolution, and the Vĩnh Hòa being referred to is in Quảng Trị.\n\nFrom the resolutions examined, I couldn't find a direct reference to \"Xã Vĩnh Hòa, Huyện Chợ Lách, Tỉnh Bến Tre\". It's possible the arrangement predated the resolutions, or that the relevant resolution isn't included in the provided list.  I'll need to expand my search.\n",
