First, I'll break down the address: ward, district, and province.  I know I need to check for any reorganizations.\n\nBased on my understanding of the 60-NQ/TW resolutions, I've got to find out what happened to \"Tỉnh Bến Tre\".  Looks like it was merged with \"Vĩnh Long\" and \"Trà Vinh\" to become \"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\". Got it.\n\nNow, focusing on the ward/commune level, which is \"Xã Sơn Phú\" in \"Huyện Giồng Trôm\".  I need to go through all the relevant resolutions to see if there's any mention of \"Sơn Phú\".  I've systematically checked each one, ignoring those that are in the wrong province, like Bắc Ninh, Đà Nẵng, Đắk Lắk, Gia Lai, Hà Tĩnh, Lâm Đồng, Ninh Bình, Thái Nguyên, Tuyên Quang, and Thanh Hóa.\n\nI found mentions of \"Sơn Phú\" in a few of those, but those are in different provinces. I need to be careful of that.\n\nFinally, I got to the resolution for the new province, Vĩnh Long.  I looked at each line carefully, but it doesn't look like any of the changes there affect \"Sơn Phú\".  I saw that \"Giồng Trôm\" is mentioned in reference to the old district, but no renames for \"Xã Sơn Phú.\" It looks like no relevant changes. So the new administrative unit remains the same. The answer is **Xã Sơn Phú, Huyện Giồng Trôm, Tỉnh Vĩnh Long**.\n",

First, I need to figure out what's changed.  \\\"Tỉnh Bến Tre\\\" rings a bell.  Ah, yes, per the merger resolutions (specifically, 60-NQ/TW), Bến Tre was combined with Vĩnh Long and Trà Vinh to become Vĩnh Long.  So, my `province_name` is now \\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\".\\n\\nNext, the tricky part: \\\"Xã Sơn Phú\\\". I have to cross-reference this ward with the \\\"Other resolutions,\\\" focusing on those impacting \\\"Tỉnh Vĩnh Long\\\" or the old \\\"Tỉnh Bến Tre\\\". I see several relevant resolutions (e.g., 1687/NQ-UBTVQH15).\\n\\nI've carefully scanned these resolutions, specifically looking for any mention of \\\"Xã Sơn Phú.\\\"  I initially thought I might find something related to \\\"Giồng Trôm\\\" (the old district), but no luck there. There are lines regarding the merging of other wards, like Bình Hòa, Bình Thành, Long Mỹ, Mỹ Thạnh, Lương Hòa, and Phong Nẫm. However, nothing for \\\"Sơn Phú\\\".\\n\\nI expanded my search across all the resolutions to look for \\\"Sơn Phú\\\" anywhere, just to be sure. I encountered mentions of \\\"Sơn Phú\\\" in resolutions concerning Hà Tĩnh, Thái Nguyên, and Tuyên Quang - but these are completely unrelated to Bến Tre or Vĩnh Long.  They involve different Sơn Phús, if you will!\\n\\nTherefore, based on the provided resolutions, I *cannot* definitively determine a new administrative name or status for \\\"Xã Sơn Phú\\\" within the context of the recent province/ward reorganizations.  It's not listed as being merged or renamed in any of the resolutions I have.

I've checked the ones about Vĩnh Long, but there's no direct mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Phú\\\\\\\" in the reorganization plans I see. I've specifically scanned the lists in the documents provided for the name \\\\\\\"Sơn Phú\\\\\\\" and I have not found any mention of it in the resolutions related to the new province.\\\\n\\\\nIt seems that \\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Phú\\\\\\\" hasn't been explicitly merged into a new unit, according to the documents I have.
