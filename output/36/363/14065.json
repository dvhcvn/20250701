  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Trực Thuận\"**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the old address \"Xã Trực Thuận, Huyện Trực Ninh, Tỉnh Nam Định\" and need to find its new administrative unit. My initial thought is to tackle this systematically, leveraging my understanding of how administrative changes are structured and documented.\n\nFirst, I identified the province, \"Tỉnh Nam Định.\" Then, I immediately consulted the province merger resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW. This quickly revealed that \"Tỉnh Nam Định\" is no longer a standalone entity; it's now part of \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình.\" This simplification is common in administrative restructuring, so it's a good starting point.\n\nNext, I focused on identifying the specific old ward, \"Xã Trực Thuận.\" My instinct was to search for relevant resolutions relating to \"Xã Trực Thuận\" and \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình,\" or the old \"Tỉnh Nam Định.\" I located resolution 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, focusing specifically on rearranging administrative units in Ninh Binh.\n\nHere's where it got interesting. I meticulously reviewed the resolution, and while I didn't see a direct mention of \"Xã Trực Thuận\" in one section, I immediately encountered line 38: It clearly detailed the merging of several wards, including \"Xã Trực Thuận,\" into the new administrative unit, \"Xã Quang Hưng.\"\n\nThat was the key! The resolution gave me the new ward name. Now, to be absolutely certain, I cross-referenced this new name and province information with the \"New wards\" list. And there it was: \"Xã Quang Hưng\" with a corresponding ward code (\"14062\") listed under \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình.\"\n\nI can now confidently construct the JSON output: the province is \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\" (due to the merger), the new ward is \"Xã Quang Hưng,\" with the code \"14062\". I also included the citation, pinpointing line 38 of resolution 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, that confirms that that is what I should state as my output. The matching ward and direct mention of the specific old ward in the resolution mean the confidence level is appropriately \"high.\" This method is both efficient and thorough, aligning with standard practice in analyzing such administrative transitions.\n",
