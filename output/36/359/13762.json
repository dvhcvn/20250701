  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, so I'm being asked to figure out the new administrative unit (ward) for the old address \"Xã Cộng Hòa, Huyện Vụ Bản, Tỉnh Nam Định\".  This requires a careful, step-by-step approach.  First, I need to understand that administrative boundaries frequently change, especially within Vietnam.  My expertise comes in because I'm able to efficiently navigate and interpret these changes.\n\nHere's my thinking:\n\n1.  **Old Province Identification:** The initial task is straightforward: the old province is \"Tỉnh Nam Định\".\n\n2.  **Province Mergers:**  I immediately consult the relevant resolutions (specifically, 60-NQ/TW and related documents) to determine if any province mergers or divisions have occurred. In this case, I quickly find that \"Tỉnh Nam Định\" was merged into \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình.\" So, I need to shift my focus to the new province.\n\n3.  **Old Ward Identification:** The old ward is \"Xã Cộng Hòa.\"\n\n4.  **Finding the New Ward within the New Province:** Now, I must search through the resolutions pertaining to \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\" looking for mentions of \"Xã Cộng Hòa\". This is where meticulousness is key.  I'm specifically scanning resolutions related to administrative rearrangements within Ninh Bình.\n\n    *   Resolution \"1674/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Ninh Bình\" is the key. Within this resolution, line 23 explicitly states that \"Xã Cộng Hòa\" and \"Xã Minh Tân\" were merged to form \"xã Minh Tân.\"  This is a definitive statement, and it's exactly what I'm looking for.\n\n5.  **Identifying the New Ward Name and Code:** I then cross-reference this finding with a list of new wards, again within the context of \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\".  I confirm that \"xã Minh Tân\" exists, and it has a corresponding code (13750).\n\n6.  **Constructing the Output:** Given these findings, I will create the JSON output:\n\n    *   `province_name`: \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\"\n    *   `ward_name`: \"Xã Minh Tân\"\n    *   `ward_code`: \"13750\"\n    *   `confidence`: \"high\" (because the merger is explicitly stated in a resolution)\n    *   `citation`: \"1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 23\"\n\n7.  **Verification and Thoroughness:** To ensure complete accuracy, I *always* double-check by reviewing other resolutions. I search for \"Xã Cộng Hòa\" or its variations across all applicable resolutions.  I checked many other relevant resolutions and found that none of the other mentions are applicable. These references either refer to different types of administrative units (such as *phường* rather than *xã*) or are in different provinces altogether.\n\n    The inclusion of \"Huyện Vụ Bản\" in the old address is also noted, but since the resolutions generally involve removing districts, this is not relevant to determining the new *ward* or *province*.  The focus has to be on the ward and province mapping after the rearrangement.\n\nIn summary, I'm confident in my analysis.  The final result: \"Xã Cộng Hòa\" in \"Tỉnh Nam Định\" is now part of \"Xã Minh Tân\" in \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\".  The supporting evidence is solid, the methodology is sound, and I've ensured a comprehensive review of all available data.  That's how I approach these types of problems, ensuring precision and accuracy.\n",
