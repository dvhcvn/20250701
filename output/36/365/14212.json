  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an old Vietnamese address: Xã Giao Phong, Huyện Giao Thủy, Tỉnh Nam Định. My task is to translate this into the new administrative structure, and I've got a clear plan of action.\n\nFirst things first, I break down the address into its components: Ward (Xã Giao Phong), District (Huyện Giao Thủy), and Province (Tỉnh Nam Định).  I need to find the equivalent in the new system.\n\nI'm starting with the Province resolutions, specifically Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This is where I find the initial clue: Nam Định is no more! It's been merged with Hà Nam and Ninh Bình to form a new province called Ninh Bình.  This is a significant shift, obviously.\n\nNext, I shift my focus to Resolution 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15.  This one is specifically about Ninh Bình, so it's promising.  I scan the resolution for any mention of Xã Giao Phong.  And bingo! Line 59 tells the whole story:  Xã Giao Phong, along with Giao Thịnh and Quất Lâm, is being combined into a new Xã called Giao Ninh.  It's very specific.\n\nNow, I check the \"New wards\" data.  I'm looking for \"Xã Giao Ninh.\"  I confirm its presence.  I find the code: 14212.  Crucially, it's also associated with Tỉnh Ninh Bình, which reinforces the earlier province merger.\n\nWith this solid information, I construct the JSON output. The province is now Ninh Bình. The ward is Giao Ninh, and I have the ward code.  I'll include the relevant citation from Resolution 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 59, to back up my findings. And I'm going to set my confidence level to \"high\" because the mapping is unambiguous; it is stated directly in this line.\n\nRegarding the district, Huyện Giao Thủy, it isn't listed for a one-to-one conversion. If the schema were to include this, I'd need to consider a potential change in my method of interpreting the information. But for now, the schema is clear, and the only two important pieces of information are the province and ward.\n\nOverall, it's a straightforward mapping based on a direct reference in the resolution.  It should be a reliable translation.\n",
