  "thought": "**Analyzing the Vietnamese Address Transition**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a historical Vietnamese address and tasked with mapping it to its current administrative structure. My starting point is \"Xã Giao Hải, Huyện Giao Thủy, Tỉnh Nam Định.\"\n\nFirst things first, I need to deal with the province: \"Tỉnh Nam Định.\"  I immediately recall that resolution 60-NQ/TW addresses this. After a quick check, I confirm that \"Tỉnh Nam Định\" was merged and is now part of \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình.\"\n\nNext, I look at the ward level: \"Xã Giao Hải.\" I know there's typically some reshuffling at this level, so I dive into the provided resolutions. I zero in on 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one related to administrative reorganizations in Ninh Bình. Bingo! Line 56 of that resolution explicitly outlines the fate of \"Xã Giao Hải\": it, along with two other wards, forms the new \"Xã Giao Phúc.\"\n\nNow, I need the details for this new ward. I check my \"New wards\" list, and sure enough, \"Xã Giao Phúc\" is there, complete with code \"14203\" and, importantly, listed under \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình.\" This confirms my previous findings regarding the province.\n\nPutting it all together, I can construct the JSON output. The province is definitely \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình.\" The ward is \"Xã Giao Phúc\" with a code of \"14203.\" For the citation, I'll use 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically line 56, because that's the key resolution here.  And the confidence level? It's **high**, because everything aligns perfectly and all the mapping is explicitly documented in the provided resolutions and lists.  The province merger result and the new ward details from the list both point to \"Tỉnh Ninh Bình\" as the new province.\n\nEssentially, I've tracked the transformation of \"Xã Giao Hải\" through the province and ward realignments, and I'm very confident in this mapping. My expertise has quickly parsed the relevant resolutions and lists. This should be a clean and accurate mapping.\n",
