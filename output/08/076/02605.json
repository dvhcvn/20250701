  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Thiện Kế, Tuyên Quang\"**\n\nOkay, so the user wants to know the new administrative unit for \"Xã Thiện Kế\" in Tuyên Quang province. My initial thought is to break this down. First, I need to identify the old ward, district (although I know the prompt mentioned \"eliminating districts\", the information will be helpful in the thought process), and province. In this case, it's pretty straightforward: \"Xã Thiện Kế\", \"Huyện Sơn Dương\", and \"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\".\n\nNext, I'll start checking the province resolutions. Since the prompt implies provinces aren't changing, and I know that Tuyên Quang and Hà Giang were combined in the past and are now back to their original states, Tuyên Quang *remains* Tuyên Quang. So, I don't need to look too hard there.\n\nNow for the *real* work: those resolutions. I'll need to meticulously scan through the provided list, focusing on any mention of \"Xã Thiện Kế\" within Tuyên Quang. I'll start with 60-NQ/TW, then move on to other resolutions, one by one.  I'm looking for a resolution that specifically mentions \"Xã Thiện Kế\" in Tuyên Quang and what it has become.\n\nI quickly check the first few resolutions, like 1666/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Hưng Yên), 1675/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Huế), and 1679/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Quảng Ninh) - and eliminate them as not relevant. Then I notice the 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Phú Thọ. Although I *do* see \"Xã Thiện Kế\" there, the province is Phú Thọ, not Tuyên Quang, so I dismiss it.\n\nThen I get to the key resolution: 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, the Tuyên Quang resolution! I read through the resolution carefully. It mentions multiple mergers, and, bingo, resolution item #39 confirms it: it is about \"Xã Thiện Kế\" and merges it into something else. The item states that \"Xã Thiện Kế\" is merged with other \"xã\" to form a new \"xã\" called \"Sơn Thủy\".\n\nI need to confirm this with the `New wards` data. I'll search for \"Sơn Thủy\" there. And there it is! \"Xã Sơn Thuỷ\"! The spelling is slightly different (with a 'y' instead of an 'i'), but that's a common variation in Vietnamese, and it's clearly a match.  The new ward code is 02620, the name is \"Xã Sơn Thuỷ\" and the province is Tuyên Quang.\n\nTherefore, my final conclusion is: \"Xã Thiện Kế\" from Tuyên Quang is now part of \"Xã Sơn Thuỷ\". I can confidently say this because of resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 and the corresponding entry in the \"New wards\" data. My confidence is high.\n",
