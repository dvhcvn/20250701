The user's asking about \"Xã Quí Quân, Huyện Yên Sơn, Tỉnh Tuyên Quang.\" First, I need to confirm the province. The resolution 60-NQ/TW doesn't invalidate \"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang,\" it just merges it with Hà Giang, so we're good there.\n\nNow, I'm diving into the resolutions to see if \"Xã Quí Quân\" or \"Huyện Yên Sơn\" are explicitly mentioned in any of them. The list is long, so I'm quickly scanning each one, looking for keywords. No luck with the majority, but resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Tuyên Quang) looks promising.\n\nLine 32 in that resolution creates a new \"Xã Yên Sơn\" from the old district town and a few other communes.  Crucially, \"Xã Quí Quân\" isn't explicitly listed in that merger. However, the *new* commune is named after the *old* district, and that's a key clue. My understanding of these reorganization efforts is that when a new commune takes the district's name, it's often because a significant number, if not all, of the district's communes are being folded into it.\n\nSince \"Xã Quí Quân\" was part of \"Huyện Yên Sơn,\" and the new \"Xã Yên Sơn\" is the district-name-sake, it's highly probable that \"Xã Quí Quân\" is now part of this new, expanded \"Xã Yên Sơn,\" even if it isn't specifically called out in the snippet. The snippet might not be exhaustive.  It's a strong hypothesis, based on the naming pattern and the context. The alternative is that \"Xã Quí Quân\" became part of a new commune and that's not listed, so I'll go with this likely conclusion.\n",

That's straightforward.\\n\\nNow, the real challenge begins.  I need to check these resolutions regarding the \\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã\\\" to see if \\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\" or \\\"Huyện Yên Sơn\\\" are explicitly mentioned. I'm focusing on those specific resolutions for Tuyên Quang.\\n\\nI carefully examined Resolution 1684/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key resolution for Tuyên Quang's ward restructuring. I see merges, like Tân Tiến into Tân Long, and the formation of a new Yên Sơn ward by combining the old thị trấn Yên Sơn with surrounding wards. However, and this is crucial, **\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\" is nowhere to be found in these documents.**\\n\\nThis absence presents a few possible scenarios.  It's likely that:\\n\\n1.  \\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\" was unaffected by *these* specific resolutions and, therefore, remains unchanged.\\n2.  It was subject to a different, *unprovided*, resolution.\\n3.  It's part of a larger merge where it's implicitly included, but not individually named in this resolution. Given the specificity of the document and the lack of mention of it, the last is not the primary case.\\n\\nThe prompt notes that most wards were changed, and a few remained the same. Considering that \\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\" is absent from these detailed merger descriptions, it's the *most likely* it remained unchanged. The problem is that the prompt asks to find a new unit. If the unit is unchanged, finding a new unit to indicate that the old unit is unchanged is not possible.\\n\\nGiven this, while I can't definitively identify a *new* ward name for \\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\" based on the provided material, my assessment is that it most likely remains \\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\" since it is not listed as merged, split, or renamed in this set of resolutions.  Without further information or alternative resolutions, a more precise mapping isn't possible, but I can't be sure, as the prompt asks for *new* units.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\",\n        \"line\": \"1.

The user has given me an old address: \\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân, Huyện Yên Sơn, Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\" and wants me to figure out the new administrative unit. My initial steps involve clarifying the province name, which remains \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Tuyên Quang\\\\\\\" based on the provided source.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the core of the problem lies in \\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Huyện Yên Sơn.\\\\\\\" I've been given some resolutions focusing on \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã\\\\\\\" - essentially, reorganizing wards. I've meticulously checked the relevant resolutions for Tuyên Quang. I found that while the resolutions mention \\\\\\\"Huyện Yên Sơn,\\\\\\\" they specifically discuss the merging and renaming of *other* wards within the district, such as \\\\\\\"Tân Tiến\\\\\\\" being absorbed into \\\\\\\"Tân Long.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe crucial point is this: **\\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\\\\\" is conspicuously absent from all the resolutions I've examined.** Given the nature of these resolutions, which are quite specific about the affected wards, I must conclude that \\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\\\\\" is not explicitly mentioned.\\\\n\\\\nNow, here's where it gets tricky. The prompt states that most wards have been renamed, split, or merged, with a small number kept unchanged.  Since \\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\\\\\" isn't listed among the changes, it *could* have been one of those unchanged wards. However, if it's unchanged, then the new ward would be named \\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\\\\\". The task requires me to find \\\\\\\"one or multiple new ward(s)\\\\\\\". It's not in the new list, so I can't confirm this.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, based on the provided information, I can't definitively map \\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\\\\\" to a *new* ward. The resolutions don't give me enough information.  It could mean:\\\\n\\\\n1.  \\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\\\\\" was unaffected by these particular resolutions.\\\\n2.  It was altered by a resolution *not* provided.\\\\n3.  It's part of a broader merge that's not explicitly detailed in the provided data.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the scope of the resolutions, the latter is less likely. Without more data, I can't provide a certain answer.  I can only say \\\\\\\"Xã Quí Quân\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in these re-organization resolutions.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"1.
