  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for \"Xã Ea Tam, Huyện Krông Năng, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"**\n\nAlright, let's break this down systematically. My initial task is to pinpoint the new administrative entity corresponding to the old ward \"Xã Ea Tam\" in Krông Năng district, Đắk Lắk province.\n\nFirst, I identified the key components: ward name (\"Xã Ea Tam\"), district (\"Huyện Krông Năng\"), and province (\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"). I knew Đắk Lắk was involved in some re-organization, so I immediately checked the province resolutions.  Sure enough, the province still exists, even though it's been merged with Phú Yên.\n\nNext, I delved into the relevant resolutions, specifically looking for mentions of \"Xã Ea Tam\" or \"Huyện Krông Năng.\" Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 jumped out. Line 23 immediately caught my eye, explicitly stating that \"Xã Ea Tam\" was being merged with \"Cư Klông\" and \"Tam Giang\" to form the new ward \"Xã Tam Giang\". Excellent!  Line 86 mentioned a \"Phường Ea Tam\", but that's a different animal – a ward, not a commune. The input specified a commune, so I disregarded that for now.\n\nNow, did I have a match? Yes, but I'm cautious. I need to confirm. I looked in my list of `new wards` and indeed found \"Xã Tam Giang\" listed, with the correct province.\n\nTo be extra certain, I considered the possibility of a naming ambiguity. Is it possible there are two units called \"Ea Tam\", one a commune and the other a ward?  Yes, potentially.  But the context (Huyện vs. Thành phố, Xã vs. Phường) strongly suggests these are distinct entities. Furthermore, line 23 explicitly mentions it and the context is very good.\n\nSo, I concluded that \"Xã Ea Tam, Huyện Krông Năng\" had become \"Xã Tam Giang\" in Đắk Lắk. The evidence is solid: the resolution explicitly states the merge. The corresponding entry in my `new wards` data confirms it. The other resolution mentions \"Phường Ea Tam\" is irrelevant due to the input's focus on a commune, not a ward. My confidence is very high. I have my citation: Resolution 1660, line 23.\n\nI then constructed the JSON output.  I'm confident in this result:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"citation\": {\n      \"header\": \"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\",\n      \"line\": \"23.

I need to break down the task, analyze the data, and then synthesize the findings into a clear JSON output.\\n\\nFirst, I looked at the province, \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\", checking the resolutions to see if it was merged with another province. It wasn't, but I still want to check the resolutions specifically for Đắk Lắk.\\n\\nI started by examining the province resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW. It didn't provide any merging scenarios.\\n\\nThen, I focused on the other resolutions, which are the main source of the ward mapping information. I identified two main resolutions: 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, specific to Đắk Lắk, and 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, which I can skip because it applies to Gia Lai.\\n\\nAnalyzing resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 was key. I found these important lines: \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Ea Tam, Cư Klông và Tam Giang thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tam Giang**.\\\" This directly impacts my original ward.

The user needs me to figure out the current location of \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\" in Krông Năng district, Đắk Lắk province, based on the provided resolutions. Right off the bat, I know I'm dealing with administrative changes. Let's break this down.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand what has changed in Đắk Lắk. I start with the province-level resolution (60-NQ/TW), but that's a red herring. It talks about merging Đắk Lắk with Phú Yên, but the name \\\\\\\"Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\" remains. Okay, so that's not it.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I dive into the resolutions concerning specific wards and communes (1660/NQ-UBTVQH15). And bingo! Line 23 specifically states that \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\" (the thing I'm looking for) has been merged with two other communes to form \\\\\\\"Xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\". This is a direct match, and I'm feeling confident about this one.\\\\n\\\\nThen, there is the second hit that mentions the entity \\\\\\\"Ea Tam\\\\\\\" and it's on Line 86. This one mentions \\\\\\\"**phường** Ea Tam\\\\\\\". So it's not the target \\\\\\\"Xã\\\\\\\" Ea Tam, it's a different type. However, that *is* mentioned in the resolution as merged to form \\\\\\\"Phường Ea Kao.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nNow, I look at the new ward database. There are five candidates, but two of them don't fall into the right province. Another one matches a name in the resolution, but not the one I'm looking for. So, this confirms my confidence in the resolution. Then, I see two matches: \\\\\\\"Phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nTaking all of this together, I now have my findings:\\\\n\\\\n*   The direct match is: **Xã Tam Giang**\\\\n    *   This is the new administrative unit where the old \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\" is now located. Line 23 of 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 clearly states this. This is a *high confidence* match.\\\\n\\\\nI am ready to build my response in the specific JSON format.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"23.

The user needs the new administrative unit for the address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam, Huyện Krông Năng, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is a straightforward task, but we need to ensure accuracy, given the potential for changes in Vietnamese administrative divisions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, the province is a non-issue. Based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" after its brief merger with Phú Yên. That takes care of the province.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the core issue is the ward. The user provided resolutions for both Đắk Lắk and Gia Lai, but my focus is on Đắk Lắk. Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically titled \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is the one. Time to delve into the lines.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLine 23 immediately catches my eye: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Ea Tam, Cư Klông và Tam Giang thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tam Giang**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Bingo! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is explicitly mentioned as merging into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is a strong lead.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, line 86 presents a wrinkle: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của phường Ea Tam và xã Ea Kao thành phường mới có tên gọi là **phường Ea Kao**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which is, interestingly, the same name.  This is where my expertise comes into play. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are different administrative levels. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" usually refers to an urban ward, whereas \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" designates a more rural area. The original address is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam, Huyện Krông Năng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Since the district is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Krông Năng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", it's unlikely that the address would be in a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This could introduce some ambiguity or an unreported change. The resolution doesn't specify the districts. We must verify this.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on line 23, the strongest indication points to the new ward being **Xã Tam Giang**. While, further investigations are warranted for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for comprehensive analysis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"23.

First, I need to isolate the old administrative units, which are straightforward: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Krông Năng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (province). The prompt emphasizes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"eliminating all districts,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" so my primary focus will be on the ward and province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, let's dive into those Resolutions. First, I check for province-level changes, specifically Resolution 60-NQ/TW.  I quickly see that Tỉnh Đắk Lắk isn't slated for elimination. It's listed in the merging list: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"15. Hợp nhất tỉnh Đắk Lắk và tỉnh Phú Yên, lấy tên là tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is interesting; essentially, Đắk Lắk remains Đắk Lắk, but absorbs Phú Yên.  This means the province will still be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for our new ward mapping.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to investigate any ward-level changes within Đắk Lắk. I start with Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, specific to Đắk Lắk. Line 21 isn't relevant, but then I hit Line 23:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Ea Tam, Cư Klông và Tam Giang thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tam Giang**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Bingo! \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is explicitly mentioned as merging into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tam Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That's a strong candidate.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, I need to be thorough. Line 86 of the same resolution has me raising an eyebrow: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của phường Ea Tam và xã Ea Kao thành phường mới có tên gọi là **phường Ea Kao**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This references a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The input is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Is this a simple typo? Or is it a case of an older Xã being upgraded to a Phường, or are they different units? There's an ambiguity here. My expert instinct says I need to consider both, since this is about *possible* matches. To be safe, I'll include it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTo double-check for any other changes, I briefly glanced at Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Gia Lai. However, I didn't see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or anything related, so I dismissed it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, I checked my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list.  First, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 fits perfectly. It's a high confidence match.  Second, the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 also matches the list. Therefore, I'll propose two possible new wards.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"23.

First, I need to break down the original address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Krông Năng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (district, though I'm told to ignore districts), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (province).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI'm starting with the province, and checking Resolution 60-NQ/TW. I see that Đắk Lắk isn't in the list of provinces *not* undergoing mergers. Looking in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"new provinces\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list, there's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"15. Hợp nhất tỉnh Đắk Lắk và tỉnh Phú Yên, lấy tên là tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That means that Đắk Lắk is staying Đắk Lắk, but potentially incorporating Phú Yên. So, the province name for the new ward should still be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, onto the tricky part: the ward. I need to consult other resolutions, focusing on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within Đắk Lắk. Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 catches my attention immediately. I see line 21, but it doesn't mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, line 23 is a potential match! It states: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Ea Tam, Cư Klông và Tam Giang thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Tam Giang**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This directly says that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is being merged into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tam Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That's a strong candidate.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFurther down, line 86 introduces a potential complication: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của phường Ea Tam và xã Ea Kao thành phường mới có tên gọi là **phường Ea Kao**.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Now, the original input is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This line mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Is this the *same* unit? It's possible \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was upgraded to a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or that these are different units. The fact it's mentioned in a merger, means it is a candidate that should be checked, despite potential ambiguity. I'll have to keep this in mind as a lower-confidence possibility.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI move onto Resolution 1664/NQ-UBTVQH15, but it doesn't mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" at all, so I can disregard it for this analysis.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFinally, the new ward mapping.

High confidence here, as it's a direct merger.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **For \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (from 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 86):** There's a match `{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"24169\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}`. Low confidence here, but as per instructions, it is valid to be used as a possible match.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, my analysis suggests that the old ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" could map to **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"** (high confidence) or **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"** (lower confidence).
