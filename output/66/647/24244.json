  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Address Change**\n\nOkay, so I've got this old address: \"Xã Tân Hoà, Huyện Buôn Đôn, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\". My goal is to determine the new administrative unit.\n\nFirst, I broke down the address: \"Xã Tân Hoà\" (Ward), \"Huyện Buôn Đôn\" (District), and \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" (Province). I know that Đắk Lắk is still a valid province, so that's good.\n\nNow, I'm diving into the resolutions, specifically looking at the ones related to administrative changes. My target is resolution \"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15\", which deals with restructuring wards in Đắk Lắk.\n\nI scanned through the lines and, bingo, line 6 caught my eye: it mentions merging \"Tân Hòa\" with \"Ea Huar\" and \"Ea Wer\" to create \"Xã Ea Wer\". The tricky part is, the resolution doesn't explicitly state the district for this \"Tân Hòa\". I have to be careful here, given my original address.\n\nLine 7 and 84 weren't relevant, since they didn't specifically reference the district I was concerned about. Line 96 also had no bearing on my research.\n\nAfter re-reading the text, I'm reasonably confident. While the resolution is unclear on the district, the most logical conclusion, given the original address, is that the \"Tân Hòa\" in line 6 is the one I'm looking for. So, the new ward is \"Xã Ea Wer\".\n\nJust to be sure, I cross-referenced this with the \"New wards\" list, looking for \"Xã Ea Wer\" in Đắk Lắk. And there it is: `{\"ward_code\":\"24241\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ea Wer\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"}`. It's a perfect match! That confirms it. I have the new administrative unit.\n",

My initial approach is to focus on the province, which is Đắk Lắk. I know from my knowledge base that there haven't been recent province-level mergers impacting this province. Now, I need to dive into the specific resolutions for ward-level adjustments.\\n\\nI've got this resolution (1660/NQ-UBTVQH15) that deals with the reorganization of wards in Đắk Lắk. I'm focusing on lines that mention \\\"Tân Hoà\\\" within \\\"Huyện Buôn Đôn\\\".\\n\\nI see line 6: \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Ea Huar, Tân Hòa và Ea Wer thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Ea Wer**.\\\" This is promising because it has \\\"Tân Hoà\\\". However, the resolution doesn't explicitly state \\\"Huyện Buôn Đôn\\\" alongside \\\"Tân Hòa\\\" in this specific line. This raises a red flag; other lines in the resolution (like line 7) are careful to specify the district if it's relevant, such as \\\"Ea Bar (huyện Buôn Đôn)\\\". The lack of district specification for \\\"Tân Hòa\\\" in line 6 is making me think it might be referring to a different \\\"Tân Hòa\\\" that isn't the one in Buôn Đôn, or that there's some implicit context I'm missing.\\n\\nI'm checking the data for \\\"Xã Ea Wer\\\" just in case, but my confidence level is low based on the lack of district context for \\\"Tân Hòa.\\\" The other lines in this resolution don't seem relevant. Specifically, I discarded lines 7, 84 and 96 as they didn't match the criteria.\\n\\nEssentially, while I found a line that *mentions* \\\"Tân Hòa\\\", the lack of clear specificity regarding \\\"Huyện Buôn Đôn\\\" in that line leaves me uncertain. I need to re-evaluate the context of line 6 carefully, maybe by cross-referencing with other sources to confirm or rule out the connection to \\\"Xã Tân Hoà, Huyện Buôn Đôn, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\".\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\",\n        \"line\": \"6.

The user's query is straightforward: find the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Hoà, Huyện Buôn Đôn, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\". My initial thought is to verify the province, then dig into relevant resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the province, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk, remains unchanged as per resolution 60-NQ/TW. No province-level mergers here.\\\\n\\\\nNow for the crucial part: the local-level administrative changes. I'll focus on the relevant resolution, 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Đắk Lắk's ward adjustments.  Scanning for \\\\\\\"Tân Hòa\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\"Huyện Buôn Đôn\\\\\\\" is key.\\\\n\\\\nLine 6, specifically: \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Ea Huar, Tân Hòa và Ea Wer thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Ea Wer**.\\\\\\\" This is the first promising lead.  We've got \\\\\\\"Tân Hòa\\\\\\\", and we're seeing it grouped with \\\\\\\"Ea Huar\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Ea Wer\\\\\\\" forming \\\\\\\"xã Ea Wer\\\\\\\".  However, there's a wrinkle: the resolution *doesn't* explicitly state \\\\\\\"Huyện Buôn Đôn\\\\\\\" next to \\\\\\\"Tân Hòa\\\\\\\" in this line.  This lack of specification raises a red flag; other lines in this resolution (e.g., line 7) clearly specify the district when needed (\\\\\\\"Ea Bar (huyện Buôn Đôn)\\\\\\\").  This lack of explicit district information, in combination with the high incidence of the name \\\\\\\"Tân Hòa,\\\\\\\" means I need to exercise caution here.\\\\n\\\\nI've got to investigate further, though. I'll check the associated data for \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Wer\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk,\\\\\\\" just in case. There is indeed data for \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Wer\\\\\\\" in the region. Still, given the nuance of the district specification, I'm labeling this connection as having low confidence. The fact that other wards are explicitly linked to districts raises doubt, so a stronger confirmation is needed.\\\\n\\\\nI've also reviewed lines 7, 84 and 96 to check for any other relevant administrative adjustments. Lines 7 and 96 are easily eliminated as irrelevant, but line 84 does mention \\\\\\\"phường Tân Hòa\\\\\\\" within Buôn Ma Thuột city. This helps to reinforce the need for a more specific resolution for determining the correct ward for \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Hoà, Huyện Buôn Đôn, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMy gut tells me that line 6 *might* be relevant, but without more explicit verification confirming \\\\\\\"Tân Hòa\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"Huyện Buôn Đôn,\\\\\\\"  I cannot definitively state that \\\\\\\"Xã Tân Hoà, Huyện Buôn Đôn\\\\\\\" has been merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Wer.\\\\\\\" More information on the provenance of these records would be required to be certain, due to the implicit interpretation of ward placement.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"6.
