  "thought": "**Mapping the Old Address to the New Unit: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a Vietnamese address and asked to find its corresponding administrative unit. The old address is located in \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" and specifically in \"Xã Ea Wer\". My first task is to confirm if Đắk Lắk has undergone any changes. Consulting the resolutions, \"60-NQ/TW\" doesn't list Đắk Lắk for any mergers or dissolutions. While there's mention of Đắk Lắk and Phú Yên being merged, the result is still \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\", so that part is straightforward.\n\nNow, focusing on \"Xã Ea Wer,\" I pull up resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key piece here. Line 6 directly addresses it!  It explicitly states that \"Ea Wer,\" along with other communes, is *merged* to form a *new* commune also named \"Xã Ea Wer.\"  This is significant.\n\nLooking at the provided new ward data, I find a matching entry: `{\"ward_code\":\"24241\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ea Wer\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"}`. The name matches perfectly, and the province is correct. Furthermore, since the resolution explicitly states that the old \"Ea Wer\" is included in the new \"Ea Wer,\" the confidence is high. The other data entries don't match, so I can safely disregard them.\n\nTherefore, the old \"Xã Ea Wer\" with its code \"24241\" in \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" is the correct and definitive new administrative unit. It's a clear mapping based on a precise resolution that provides explicit details. I'm satisfied this is an accurate and robust solution.\n",
