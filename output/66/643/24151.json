  "thought": "**My Analysis of Phường Ea Tam's Fate**\n\nOkay, so I'm tasked with figuring out what happened to \"Phường Ea Tam\" in Buôn Ma Thuột, Đắk Lắk province. First, I confirmed that \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" is still the correct province, no surprises there. Now, I delved into the relevant resolutions, specifically checking resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one dealing with administrative unit restructuring.\n\nHere's what I found. Line 23 of the resolution mentions \"Ea Tam,\" but it's referring to \"xã Ea Tam\" (a commune), not \"phường Ea Tam\" (a ward), and it's merged into \"xã Tam Giang.\" That's a potential match, \"Tam Giang\" is in my list of new wards, but the difference between \"xã\" and \"phường\" gives me pause. It's a low-confidence lead.\n\nBut then, line 86. This one is clear as day! It states that \"phường Ea Tam\" is merged with \"xã Ea Kao\" to form \"phường Ea Kao.\" Bingo! That's a perfect match for the input. Now \"phường Ea Kao\" is confirmed in my list of new wards, and I can say this is a high-confidence finding.\n\nSo, I've got two possibilities: \"Xã Tam Giang\" (low confidence) and \"Phường Ea Kao\" (high confidence). I'll need to represent these options with appropriate confidence levels and citations in the final output. The resolution line numbers are cited for verification.\n\nMy final output will be a JSON array containing two objects: one for \"Xã Tam Giang\" (low confidence) and one for \"Phường Ea Kao\" (high confidence). The JSON schema will be followed and the structure should be correct. This should provide a complete and accurate answer to the query.\n",

I need to output this in a specific JSON format, with confidence levels and citations. Let's break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I confirmed the province, Đắk Lắk, remains unchanged after the merging. Now, I have to dive deep into resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one dealing with ward-level changes. After scanning the resolution, line 86 jumps out: it clearly states that \\\"phường Ea Tam\\\" was merged with \\\"xã Ea Kao\\\" to create a new \\\"phường Ea Kao.\\\" This is a definitive match. The corresponding new ward code from my \\\"New wards\\\" list is 24169. This is a very straightforward and clear case, so I'm labeling this with \\\"high confidence.\\\" My citation will be \\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\" and I'll specify line 86.\\n\\nHowever, I also noticed something interesting in Line 23 of the Ward Resolution: mention of \\\"xã Ea Tam\\\" (not \\\"phường Ea Tam\\\"). This seems like a different administrative unit or a potential typo. I'll make a note of this for the final JSON array. The list also includes the new ward \\\"Xã Tam Giang\\\" which should also be included in the JSON. I'll construct the JSON output: the \\\"Phường Ea Kao\\\", the most direct mapping, should have high confidence. The \\\"Xã Tam Giang\\\" will have a low confidence.\\n\\nHere's the JSON array I'll construct:\\n\\n```json\\n[\\n  {\\n    \\\"old_ward_name\\\": \\\"Phường Ea Tam\\\",\\n    \\\"old_district_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Buôn Ma Thuột\\\",\\n    \\\"old_province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\",\\n    \\\"new_wards\\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"24169\\\",\\n        \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Phường Ea Kao\\\",\\n        \\\"district_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Buôn Ma Thuột\\\",\\n        \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\",\\n        \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"high\\\",\\n        \\\"citation\\\": \\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\",\\n        \\\"citation_line\\\": \\\"86\\\"\\n      },\\n      {\\n        \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"24352\\\",\\n        \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Tam Giang\\\",\\n        \\\"district_name\\\": \\\"Huyện Cư M'gar\\\",\\n        \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\",\\n        \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n        \\\"citation\\\": \\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15\\\",\\n        \\\"citation_line\\\": \\\"23\\\"\\n      }\\n    ]\\n  }\\n]\\n```\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\",\n        \"line\": \"86.

First, I've broken down the request. The user provided the old ward, and the task is clear: find the corresponding new ward(s) and present them in a neat JSON array with confidence levels.  I've got the old ward: \\\\\\\"Phường Ea Tam, Thành phố Buôn Ma Thuột, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nAlright, let's dive into the information. I see Resolution 60-NQ/TW is about provincial mergers, and it mentions Đắk Lắk merging with Phú Yên, but that doesn't directly affect my ward mapping task. The real meat is in Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one specifically for reorganizing Đắk Lắk's wards. This is where I'll find my answers.\\\\n\\\\nI've scanned through the lines of that resolution carefully. Here's what I found:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Line 23:**  Mentioning \\\\\\\"Ea Tam\\\\\\\" alongside \\\\\\\"Cư Klông\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Tam Giang.\\\\\\\"  It says \\\\\\\"các xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\" but the input is \\\\\\\"Phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\". I'm not sure if this is relevant as \\\\\\\"các xã\\\\\\\" is different from \\\\\\\"Phường\\\\\\\".  I need to keep this in mind.\\\\n*   **Line 86:**  This is the golden nugget!  It says, \\\\\\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của phường Ea Tam và xã Ea Kao thành phường mới có tên gọi là **phường Ea Kao**.\\\\\\\" Perfect! The phrase \\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\" is explicitly mentioned in the context of creating \\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\". This is a direct hit!\\\\n\\\\nI've also got the list of new wards, including information like ward codes and province names.  Now I need to assemble the results into that nice JSON array.\\\\n\\\\nSo, here's my final reasoning and the JSON I'll present:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Candidate 1:** \\\\\\\"Phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\" (ward code 24169).\\\\n    *   **Source:** Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 86.\\\\n    *   **Confidence:** High. The resolution clearly states that \\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\" is merged into \\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\".  The source is unambiguous.\\\\n    *   **Supporting Information**: The full line reads:  \\\\\\\"86.

My goal is to determine the correct updated administrative unit for the address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Ea Tam, Thành phố Buôn Ma Thuột, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, the province is straightforward. Although the region saw changes (merger with Phú Yên), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains the valid province name, according to the resolutions. No issues there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I have to zero in on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I immediately check Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, as that should hold the critical information. I scan the relevant lines, looking for mentions of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nInitially, I found a couple of interesting leads. Line 23 indicates that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged into a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, the input is *Phường*, not *xã*. That's a potential discrepancy I need to keep in mind.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, things got clearer with Line 86. This line explicitly states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merges with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". Bingo! That's a strong match for my input address. This appears to be the definitive answer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, I have to briefly consider the ambiguity arising from the *xã* and *phường* difference. It's plausible that there might have been a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the old system. The resolution's wording is sometimes imprecise. But given the direct match with Line 86, I'm leaning heavily towards \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being the new correct designation. It's the most likely and most precise match given the input. I will need to double-check this for absolute certainty, but that's my current working hypothesis.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"86.

That's straightforward. Now, it's time to dig into those resolutions. I know \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" hasn't been merged according to resolution \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", so I can safely keep \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the `province_name` in my final output.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe key resolution is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which specifically addresses administrative restructuring in Đắk Lắk. I meticulously scanned the lines, and two caught my attention. The first one, line 23, mentioned \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" being merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That's a possible match, but there's a type discrepancy – \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the input versus \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the resolution.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, line 86 is a clear winner: it *explicitly* states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is a perfect match – the ward type is correct, and the place name is correct.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI double-checked my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data. Both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are indeed listed, which validates their existence. However, considering the clear wording of line 86, I'm confident that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" match is intriguing, but the type difference and less direct wording make me less confident in it as the primary solution.

My goal is to pinpoint the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Đắk Lắk province.  The user's query is straightforward: given an old address, what's the new one?  I need to navigate the maze of administrative restructuring resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the key information: the old ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Ea Tam,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with the city, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Buôn Ma Thuột,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" also being relevant within the province's structure.  Next, I systematically reviewed the available resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe provincial resolution, **60-NQ/TW**, isn't particularly insightful here. It confirms that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" after potential mergers. This informs the output.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe critical piece of the puzzle is resolution **1660/NQ-UBTVQH15**.  Scanning its lines, I found two potential matches:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **Potential Match 1:**  Line 23 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is included in the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  However, there's a type difference here; the input uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the resolution uses \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Potentially, the resolution's use of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is more general. I'll flag this as a potential match but a weaker one.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **Strong Match 2:**  Line 86 explicitly states that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" merge to become \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This appears to be a direct hit!\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then cross-referenced these potential new wards against my data.  The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data confirms the existence of both new administrative units: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Giang,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" both within Đắk Lắk province.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUltimately, I'm leaning heavily towards \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The explicit wording in the resolution and matching types provides a high degree of confidence. While \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Tam Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a possibility, the stronger direct reference to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Tam\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as merged to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Ea Kao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" makes that the more probable outcome.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"86.
