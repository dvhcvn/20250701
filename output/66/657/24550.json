  "thought": "**Processing the Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user needs to map the old administrative unit, *Xã Ea BHốk, Huyện Cư Kuin, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk*, to its new counterparts. The input data includes province resolutions, specific ward-level resolutions for Đắk Lắk, and a list of new wards.\n\nFirst, I identified the components of the old unit: *Xã Ea BHốk*, *Huyện Cư Kuin*, and *Tỉnh Đắk Lắk*. I then consulted the province resolutions.  While districts are considered eliminated in this context, the initial analysis confirms that the province *Tỉnh Đắk Lắk* remains, though its composition may have changed. The province name *Tỉnh Đắk Lắk* will be consistent throughout my output.\n\nThen, I focused on the specific resolution for ward-level changes in Đắk Lắk (1660/NQ-UBTVQH15).  I immediately searched for *Xã Ea BHốk* and its variations. The resolution's key lines are 50 and 51. Line 50 tells me that a portion of *Xã Ea BHốk* has been merged into *Xã Dray Bhăng*. Line 51 tells me the remaining portion merged into *Xã Ea Ktur*.\n\nI then cross-referenced these findings with the list of new wards.  Both *Xã Dray Bhăng* and *Xã Ea Ktur* are present in the list, confirming them as potential matches.\n\nFinally, I built the JSON output. Since *Xã Ea BHốk* was split, I need to output two JSON objects, one for each new ward. For *Xã Dray Bhăng*, I will include `province_name: \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"`, `ward_name: \"Xã Dray Bhăng\"`, `ward_code: \"24561\"`, `confidence: \"high\"`, and a citation to line 50 of resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15. For *Xã Ea Ktur*, I will include `province_name: \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"`, `ward_name: \"Xã Ea Ktur\"`, `ward_code: \"24544\"`, `confidence: \"high\"`, and a citation to line 51 of resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15. Because the resolution is very specific, I'm confident in these mappings. The final output is an array of these two objects, representing the complete mapping of the old ward to its new counterparts.\n",

The user needs the new administrative unit for the old address \\\"Xã Ea BHốk, Huyện Cư Kuin, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\". My first step is to analyze the address components: \\\"Xã Ea BHốk\\\" is the ward, \\\"Huyện Cư Kuin\\\" the district (though less relevant), and \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\" the province.\\n\\nSince we're dealing with administrative changes, I'll start by checking if there have been any relevant province mergers or name changes in \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\". Fortunately, the province itself remains, so that's straightforward.\\n\\nNow, I'll dive into the relevant province resolution, specifically \\\"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\". My focus is on the specific ward, \\\"Ea BHốk.\\\"\\n\\nScanning the resolution text, I find Line 50 clearly states that \\\"a part\\\" of \\\"xã Ea Bhốk\\\" was merged into a new ward called \\\"xã Dray Bhăng\\\". Then, Line 51 specifies that \\\"the remaining part\\\" of \\\"xã Ea Bhốk\\\" was merged into \\\"xã Ea Ktur\\\".\\n\\nThis presents a challenge!  \\\"Xã Ea BHốk\\\" was essentially split. Without further detail in the input address about *which part* of \\\"Xã Ea Bhốk\\\" is relevant, I can't definitively determine if the user's address is now under \\\"Xã Dray Bhăng\\\" or \\\"Xã Ea Ktur.\\\" Both are valid possibilities. The confidence level for either being correct is low.\\n\\nI'll check the \\\"New wards\\\" data to confirm the new ward names.  \\\"Xã Dray Bhăng\\\" and \\\"Xã Ea Ktur\\\" are both present and match the provided data.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer will have a low confidence. The address is likely to be within either of the new wards:  \\\"Xã Dray Bhăng\\\" (ward code 24561) or \\\"Xã Ea Ktur\\\" (ward code 24544), both in \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\".

The user's provided address is \\\\\\\"Xã Ea BHốk, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk,\\\\\\\" and I need to map it to the new administrative units. First, I identify the old ward (\\\\\\\"Xã Ea BHốk\\\\\\\") and province (\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\").\\\\n\\\\nMy initial step is to cross-reference with province resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW). This confirms that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\" remains, even though there was a merger with Phú Yên.  So, we're good on the province side.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I dive into the more detailed resolutions, particularly 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, which concerns itself with changes within \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\". This is where things get interesting. Line 50 of the resolution clearly states that \\\\\\\"một phần diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Ea Bhốk\\\\\\\" is being rearranged into a new unit named \\\\\\\"xã Dray Bhăng.\\\\\\\" Line 51 then explains that \\\\\\\"phần còn lại của xã Ea Bhốk\\\\\\\" is being integrated into a new ward called \\\\\\\"xã Ea Ktur.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThis presents a challenge: \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Bhốk\\\\\\\" is split.  This means the user's input address *could* fall within either of the new wards.\\\\n\\\\nI then check my \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" data.

This requires a \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\" confidence level because the specific part of \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Bhốk\\\\\\\" to which the user's address belongs is unknown.\\\\n\\\\nFinally, I construct the JSON output, which will have two objects, one for each possible new ward.  Each object will include the relevant citation from Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, a \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\" confidence, the province name \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk,\\\\\\\" the appropriate ward code, and the new ward name (\\\\\\\"Xã Dray Bhăng\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Ktur\\\\\\\").

This requires a careful dissection of the provided resolutions and new ward data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the key components of the old address:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea BHốk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the ward) and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the province). Now, I need to check the relevant resolutions to see how these units have changed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe initial check focuses on province resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW).

That part is straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe real challenge lies in mapping \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea BHốk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I'm digging into resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, a key source for administrative reorganizations in Đắk Lắk. Lines 50 and 51 of this resolution are crucial. They reveal that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea BHốk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been *split*. A portion now belongs to a new ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dray Bhăng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the remaining part now belongs to another new ward \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Ktur.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis split complicates the mapping. I have the new ward data, which gives me ward codes and names for both \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dray Bhăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Ktur\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  The problem is, without further information, I can't determine which specific segment of the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea BHốk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the original address corresponds to.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the split, I must report both potential matches:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1.  **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Dray Bhăng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**:\\\\\\\\n    *   **Citation**: 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk, line 50.\\\\\\\\n    *   **Confidence**: Low (because of the split)\\\\\\\\n    *   **Province Name**: Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\n    *   **Ward Code**: 24561\\\\\\\\n    *   **Ward Name**: Xã Dray Bhăng\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n2.  **\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Ea Ktur\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**:\\\\\\\\n    *   **Citation**: 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Đắk Lắk, line 51.\\\\\\\\n    *   **Confidence**: Low (because of the split)\\\\\\\\n    *   **Province Name**: Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\n    *   **Ward Code**: 24544\\\\\\\\n    *   **Ward Name**: Xã Ea Ktur\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe province name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is confirmed by the initial province resolution (60-NQ/TW).
