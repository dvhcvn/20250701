  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vietnamese address mapping task. The goal is to figure out the new administrative unit for \"Xã Ea Păl\" in Đắk Lắk.  I need to go through my data and resolutions.  First, let's extract the context: old \"Xã Ea Păl\" within \"Huyện Ea Kar,\" in \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\" I'm mentally noting that, while the prompt mentions \"eliminating all districts,\" that information is helpful for context.\n\nNow, checking the province level resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW), it's pretty straightforward. Đắk Lắk is not on the list of provinces that were combined, so its name remains unchanged.\n\nThe real meat of the problem is at the commune (xã) level. I'm focusing on Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one related to rearranging communes in Đắk Lắk.  I need to carefully scan the lines for any mention of \"Xã Ea Păl.\"  Initially, I thought I had a snag as the resolution seemed to make no mention of the ward, but upon further review, line 34 pops up. It is merging with another ward - Cư Prông to form a new Ea Păl. Aha! This is the key.\n\nThis confirms that the old \"Xã Ea Păl\" *did* contribute to the new one.  Given the merging to form a new ward, that is what is reflected in the new ward data.\n\nSo, I need to check the \"New wards\" data now.  I'm looking for \"Xã Ea Păl\" within \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\"  And there it is: a perfect match!  \"ward_code\" is \"24400,\" \"ward_name\" is \"Xã Ea Păl,\" and \"province_name\" is confirmed as \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\"\n\nFinally, I'll package this all into a clean JSON output.  The citation will come from Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically line 34. I'll flag my confidence as \"high\" because of the direct match and the explicit language in the resolution.  The province name will be \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk,\" and the ward data will be \"24400\" and \"Xã Ea Păl.\"  That should do it!\n",
