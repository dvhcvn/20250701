  "thought": "**Expert Analysis of Vietnamese Administrative Unit Mapping**\n\nOkay, here's what I've figured out, breaking it down step-by-step. My task is to pinpoint the current administrative unit corresponding to the old address: `Xã Cư Jang, Huyện Ea Kar, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk`.\n\nFirst, I parsed the input address: `Xã Cư Jang` is the ward, `Huyện Ea Kar` is the district, and `Tỉnh Đắk Lắk` is the province.\n\nNext, I checked for any province-level changes, specifically if Đắk Lắk had been merged or renamed. The resolution I found indicates that Đắk Lắk was merged with Phú Yên, but the name \"Đắk Lắk\" remains. So, the province component of the address is still valid.\n\nThen, I focused on the district and ward levels, examining the provided resolution `1660/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Đắk Lắk. This resolution deals with the creation of a new ward named `Xã Ea Kar` within the old `Huyện Ea Kar`, merging several units like `thị trấn Ea Kar`, `xã Cư Huê`, etc.\n\nCrucially, my target ward, `Xã Cư Jang`, is **not** listed among the units being merged to form the new `Xã Ea Kar`. This immediately presents a challenge.\n\nConsidering the problem statement, which says all districts were eliminated and most wards were renamed/split/merged, I'm left with very limited information. The resolution snippet I have only concerns the creation of `Xã Ea Kar` and doesn't shed any light on `Xã Cư Jang`. There's a possibility that `Xã Cư Jang` was affected by another part of the resolution (which I don't have access to), or perhaps it remained unchanged (though the problem statement makes that less probable).\n\nEssentially, I'm stuck because I lack critical data. The provided context simply isn't sufficient to determine the new administrative unit for `Xã Cư Jang`. Since I cannot find a direct mapping and have no evidence to confidently suggest any changes, I'll have to indicate a very low confidence level and return an empty result, which is the most prudent and accurate response given the data limitations.\n",

The task is to determine the new administrative unit for \\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\" in Đắk Lắk province based on the provided resolutions and new ward information.\\n\\nFirst, I identified the original administrative structure: \\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\" within \\\"Huyện Ea Kar\\\" in \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\". Next, I delved into the province-level resolutions, specifically checking if Đắk Lắk had undergone any mergers. I noted that Đắk Lắk *was* merged with Phú Yên, but the name \\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\" remains, which is crucial.\\n\\nThen, I focused on the provided resolution, `1660/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which seems relevant as it addresses social unit rearrangement within Đắk Lắk. I searched specifically for \\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\" within this resolution. However, the resolution outlined the creation of \\\"Xã Ea Kar\\\" from other wards/towns. Unfortunately, \\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\" was *not* mentioned in this resolution.\\n\\nNow, considering the provided new ward information, \\\"Xã Ea Kar\\\" is constructed from a different set of old wards, specifically \\\"thị trấn Ea Kar\\\", \\\"Cư Huê\\\", \\\"Ea Đar\\\", \\\"Ea Kmút\\\", \\\"Cư Ni\\\", and \\\"Xuân Phú\\\". Since \\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\" is not part of that list, and no other resolution specifically covers \\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\", I'm running into a data limitation.\\n\\nTherefore, because \\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\" is absent from the relevant resolution, I can't confidently map it to \\\"Xã Ea Kar\\\" or any other newly created ward based on the given information. The resolution is simply not comprehensive enough to encompass all administrative changes within Đắk Lắk. I'd have to rate my confidence in determining the new ward as \\\"low\\\" since I'm lacking the necessary piece of information on what happened to \\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\".\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\",\n        \"line\": \"15.

My task is to determine the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\\\\\" (in \\\\\\\"Huyện Ea Kar\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\") based on the provided resolutions and a list of new wards.  My initial assessment is this is going to be a bit tricky, given the information available.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the original administrative levels: \\\\\\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Huyện Ea Kar\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\". Then, I dove into the relevant resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW doesn't flag Đắk Lắk for merging with any other administrative unit. However, I found mention of a merger with Phú Yên. This is relevant to consider. This merger will have no change in the name of the province which is still \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThen I focused on resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one specifically about the rearrangement of administrative units within Đắk Lắk province.  I was looking for \\\\\\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\\\\\". Unfortunately, the resolution describes changes involving \\\\\\\"Ea Kar\\\\\\\" and neighboring wards but doesn't mention \\\\\\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe new ward listed, \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Kar\\\\\\\", is created by merging other wards. It seems this resolution covers a *subset* of the changes within the province. From the text, \\\\\\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\\\\\" is not part of the group of wards merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Ea Kar\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nFinally, looking at the provided information, I can't definitively link \\\\\\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\\\\\" to a new ward. The resolution provided simply doesn't address its status.\\\\n\\\\n**Conclusion: Low Confidence**\\\\n\\\\nBased on the evidence, my confidence is low. I don't have enough information to map \\\\\\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\\\\\" to a specific new administrative unit. The resolution provides a framework for re-organization in Đắk Lắk, but it doesn't offer any information regarding \\\\\\\"Xã Cư Jang\\\\\\\". I need more information to make a definitive determination.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"15.
