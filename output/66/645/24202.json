  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. The user provided an old address: \"Xã Ea Khal, Huyện Ea H'leo, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\" The goal is to identify the corresponding new ward. My initial focus is on the ward (\"Xã Ea Khal\"), district (Huyện Ea H'leo), and province (Tỉnh Đắk Lắk). Since the prompt mentions districts being irrelevant, I'm mainly concerned with the ward and province.\n\nFirst, I checked Resolution 60-NQ/TW to see if there were any province-level changes, but Đắk Lắk remains Đắk Lắk, though it merged with Phú Yên. Then, I zeroed in on Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, as this directly addresses ward-level changes in Đắk Lắk. This is where things get interesting.\n\nLine 17 of 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 explicitly states that \"xã Ea Khăl\" was created through a merger of Ea Nam, Ea Tir, and the *existing* Ea Khăl. This strongly suggests that \"Xã Ea Khal\" (the old) became the new \"Xã Ea Khăl\", even if the old name is spelled slightly differently. Moreover, Line 97 lists wards that *weren't* rearranged, and \"Xã Ea Khăl\" isn't on that list, solidifying the idea that it was affected by the rearrangement.\n\nFinally, I cross-referenced this with the new ward data. There's a perfect match: a record for \"Xã Ea Khăl\" (with a code \"24208\") in Đắk Lắk. Given the explicit mention in the resolution and the new ward data, it's clear the old \"Xã Ea Khal\" is now part of the new \"Xã Ea Khăl\". The slight spelling difference is most likely a minor variation.\n",
