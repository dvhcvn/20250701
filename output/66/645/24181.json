  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for a Given Address**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an old address: \"Thị trấn Ea Drăng, Huyện Ea H'leo, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\". My goal is to pinpoint the new administrative unit(s) for this address, given some resolutions and a list of new wards.  Let's break this down systematically.\n\nFirst, I parsed the old address.  I correctly identified \"Thị trấn Ea Drăng\" as the ward and \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" as the province.\n\nNow, I checked the relevant resolutions. Resolution 60-NQ/TW told me that even though there was a proposed merger of provinces, \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" remains \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\". No change there.  \n\nThe critical piece of information came from Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15.  Specifically, line 18 stated, unequivocally, that the old ward \"Thị trấn Ea Drăng\" *was merged* with two other wards (\"Ea Ral\" and \"Dliê Yang\") to form the *new* ward \"xã Ea Drăng\". That's a direct hit!\n\nLine 97 of the same resolution confirmed that \"xã Ea Drăng\" is indeed a newly formed entity. The line also provided a list of wards that *weren't* rearranged, which I kept in mind for cross-referencing later.\n\nFinally, I examined the list of new wards provided.  The entry: `{\"ward_code\":\"24181\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ea Drăng\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"}` directly matched what I found in the resolution. The province name also lined up.  I also noticed other wards listed like \"Xã Ea H’Leo\", \"Xã Ia Lốp\", etc, all of which are explicitly mentioned as not being rearranged in the resolution, which validates my understanding.\n\nThe slight discrepancy between \"Dliê Yang\" in the resolution and \"Dliê Ya\" in the new wards list caught my attention. It could be a typo, a subtle name change, or something more nuanced. But given the clear language of the resolution that \"Dliê Yang\" is part of the new \"Ea Drăng\", I concluded that the \"Dliê Ya\" entry is likely *not* a direct result of \"Thị trấn Ea Drăng\", which was merged into the new \"xã Ea Drăng\" ward.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is clear: based on the provided information and the resolutions, \"Thị trấn Ea Drăng\" is now part of the new ward \"xã Ea Drăng\" in \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\" I can confidently make that identification.\n",
