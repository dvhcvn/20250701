  "thought": "**Finding the New Administrative Unit for the Old Address**\n\nOkay, I've got the old address: \"Xã Dliê Yang, Huyện Ea H'leo, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\" My task is to figure out the new ward for this location, considering recent administrative changes. I'll need to work methodically through the available resolutions and new ward data.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the province, Đắk Lắk, has undergone any name changes. Resolution 60-NQ/TW doesn't indicate a change; Đắk Lắk remains \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" after a merger with Phú Yên, which is now irrelevant here.\n\nNow, let's focus on the critical part: the ward level. Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 seems crucial.  I see \"Xã Dliê Yang\" in the old address, so I need to check for it in this resolution. Bingo! Line 18 in Resolution 1660 explicitly states that \"Xã Dliê Yang,\" along with Ea Ral and thị trấn Ea Drăng, are merged to create a new ward named \"Xã Ea Drăng.\"  I'm confident this is the key.\n\nLine 97 of the resolution confirms this restructuring, stating most wards were rearranged or renamed, with only six exceptions listed. \"Xã Dliê Yang\" isn't on that \"do not change\" list, which further reinforces its merger.\n\nNext, I'll consult the \"new wards\" data.  I need to find \"Xã Ea Drăng\" to confirm this. I find it with the code \"24181,\" and it's confirmed to be in Đắk Lắk. Perfect. To be thorough, I check the new wards data for \"Xã Dliê Yang\" as well to ensure there isn't a different new name listed. I find \"Dliê Ya,\" a different place, and based on the resolution, I conclude the previous place is now \"Ea Drăng.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the clear language in Resolution 1660, the old ward \"Xã Dliê Yang\" is now part of the new ward \"Xã Ea Drăng,\" code \"24181.\" The province name remains unchanged. I'm highly confident in this conclusion as the resolution provides a very specific and direct answer. I'm ready to output the relevant data.\n",
