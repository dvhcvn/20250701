  "thought": "**Analyzing the Address and Administrative Changes**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with an old Vietnamese address and the goal is to map it to the new administrative structure.  The input is \"Xã Cư Prao, Huyện M'Đrắk, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\".  My initial step is to break down this address: Ward (Xã Cư Prao), District (Huyện M'Đrắk), and Province (Tỉnh Đắk Lắk).\n\nNow, the resolutions are my guide.  First, the province-level resolution, 60-NQ/TW. This confirms that Đắk Lắk remains Đắk Lắk, even though it absorbed Phú Yên at some point, which is important to remember, but doesn't impact the name itself. No province name change to worry about.\n\nThe key lies in the other resolution, 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically the part about restructuring ward-level units in Đắk Lắk.  I need to find mentions of \"Xã Cư Prao\" or \"Huyện M'Đrắk\" within the lines of this resolution.  Bingo! Line 39 in the resolution is a perfect match. It explicitly mentions that the old ward \"Xã Cư Prao\" and \"Xã Ea Pil\" are merged to form a *new* \"Xã Cư Prao\". This is precisely what I need.\n\nNext, I check the new wards data.  And there it is:  \"Xã Cư Prao\" with the correct ward code and province name \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\".  A perfect match. This solidifies my understanding that the old \"Xã Cư Prao\" is essentially the basis for the new \"Xã Cư Prao.\"\n\nNow, considering the provided context, the old addresses would only go down to the ward level, which is under the province level, and districts are removed in this restructuring. I'm confident in the mapping of \"Xã Cư Prao\" to the new \"Xã Cư Prao\". The resolution clearly supports this, and the new wards data confirms it. The elimination of districts as stated in the prompt means that the District information is no longer relevant in this context. The new address would go directly to the ward level under the province.\n\nTherefore, the confidence level is certainly \"high\" in this mapping.\n",
