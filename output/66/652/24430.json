  "thought": "**Analyzing and Mapping Vietnamese Address Changes**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with mapping an old Vietnamese address to its current administrative structure. The input address gives me: Ward: Xã Ea M' Doal, District: Huyện M'Đrắk, and Province: Tỉnh Đắk Lắk. My approach will be methodical and thorough, using the provided resolutions and ward data.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the big picture. I'll check province resolutions, specifically focusing on how they've dealt with provincial changes. I'll search for \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" in the lists provided. It's not listed as being *merged out*, which is a good start. I can also verify that it's mentioned as not being subject to provincial merges, so Tỉnh Đắk Lắk remains Tỉnh Đắk Lắk. That's straightforward enough.\n\nNow, the real work begins. I've got a resolution, \"1660/NQ-UBTVQH15,\" which seems relevant because it's specifically about re-ordering administrative units within Đắk Lắk province. I need to comb through its contents, paying close attention to any mention of \"Xã Ea M' Doal.\" Bingo! Line 36 explicitly states that \"Xã Ea M'Doal\" was merged, along with a couple of other wards, to form the new ward \"xã Ea Riêng.\" This is the key piece of information.\n\nNext, I need to validate the new ward information. I will look for \"Xã Ea Riêng\" in the provided new ward data. There it is! {\"ward_code\":\"24433\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ea Riêng\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"} - this matches perfectly.\n\nWith this matching information, I can construct the output. I'm going to create a JSON with the old ward and new ward, along with the confidence level, which will be \"high\" because the resolution directly provides the mapping for this ward and there is a direct match with the new data. I have no doubt in this case. The resolution clearly states the change, and the data confirms the existence of the newly merged unit.\n",
