  "thought": "**Deconstructing an Old Vietnamese Address**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a Vietnamese address: Xã Ia JLơi, which I need to map to its new administrative unit. The prompt indicates that districts are to be eliminated in the final output, so I'll be sure to keep that in mind as I process this. First, I need to break down the address: I see it’s located in the Xã Ia JLơi ward within the Huyện Ea Súp district, in the Tỉnh Đắk Lắk province.\n\nNow, I'll dive into the resolutions. My primary focus is on how these decrees impact the ward and province. I begin by searching the province resolutions for Đắk Lắk. I see Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Đắk Lắk remains Đắk Lắk after merging with Phú Yên. Therefore, the province stays the same for this address.\n\nNext, I need to determine the new ward for Xã Ia JLơi. I'll meticulously search through other relevant resolutions. I find 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15. I zero in on line 4, which mentions \"Xã Ia JLơi.\" Bingo! It explicitly states that Xã Ia JLơi is being merged with Cư Kbang and Ea Rốk to form a new ward, called Xã Ea Rốk.\n\nWith this crucial piece of information, I now turn to the New Wards data. I confirm that there's a record for Xã Ea Rốk in Đắk Lắk.\n\nPutting it all together, I can construct the final JSON output. The resolution that mentioned the old ward will serve as the citation. My confidence is high because of the direct mention and clear mapping between the old ward and the new Ea Rốk ward. I can confidently use the Đắk Lắk province name and the corresponding ward code and name from the New Wards data, to complete the final output. The district will not be mentioned as the prompt indicates districts should be eliminated.\n",
