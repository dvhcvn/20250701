  "thought": "**Address Mapping for Vietnamese Administrative Units**\n\nOkay, I've got a Vietnamese address to map, and it seems like a straightforward one. The old address has \"Xã Ea Rốk\" as the ward, \"Huyện Ea Súp\" as the district (though that's less relevant here, as districts are being reorganized), and \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" for the province. My goal is to find the corresponding *new* administrative unit information.\n\nFirst, I'll check the province resolutions to confirm the province hasn't changed its name. Looking at the resolutions concerning province mergers, I found that \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" remained \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" after merging with Phú Yên. That's good; no change there.\n\nNext, the critical step: I need to see if there are any resolutions regarding \"Xã Ea Rốk\". And bingo! Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically line 4, explicitly mentions \"Xã Ea Rốk\"! It states that the existing \"Xã Ea Rốk,\" along with a couple of other wards, were merged into a *new* \"Xã Ea Rốk\". This is a direct match, and it means the old ward name maps directly to the new one.\n\nNow I need to confirm the new ward details. Looking through the list of new wards for \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\", I find an entry for \"Xã Ea Rốk\" with the ward code \"24217\". Perfect!\n\nPutting it all together, I can construct the JSON output. The confidence in this mapping is \"high\" because I have a direct match in the resolution, and it confirms the existence of a new ward with the same name. I'll use Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15 as the source, specifically line 4, for the citation. The province remains \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\", and the new ward code and name are \"24217\" and \"Xã Ea Rốk\", respectively. This should be a robust and accurate mapping.\n",
