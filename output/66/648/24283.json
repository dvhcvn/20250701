  "thought": "**Mapping an Old Vietnamese Address to the New Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, so I've got this Vietnamese address to sort out, specifically mapping an old address in Đắk Lắk province to its updated administrative unit. My initial thought is to break this down into a few clear steps.\n\nFirst, I need to pinpoint the original components of the address: the ward, district, and province. Looks like we have \"Xã Ea M'DRóh\" for the ward, \"Huyện Cư M'gar\" for the district, and \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\" for the province.  Even though the prompt states districts are being eliminated, it's still useful context for the match.\n\nNext, I'll dive into the province resolutions.  I'm looking for any information on \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\" The key is resolution 60-NQ/TW, and it confirms that Đắk Lắk remains Đắk Lắk even after absorbing Phú Yên. No major change there for our purposes.\n\nNow, the crucial step: checking other resolutions for specific mentions of \"Xã Ea M'DRóh\".  I need to carefully scan the lines of the resolutions for a direct match.  And bingo! Resolution 1660/NQ-UBTVQH15, line 9, is what I'm looking for. It states that \"Ea M'DRóh\" is part of a merge to create a *new* ward also called \"xã Ea M'Droh\".  This is a direct hit!\n\nWith this resolution in hand, I can confidently head to the new ward data.  I'll look for an entry matching the province and the name of the new ward.  And there it is:  `{\"ward_code\":\"24286\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Ea M’Droh\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"}`. Perfect.\n\nNow, to assemble the final JSON output.  I'll pull the province name from step two (\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"), the ward name and code from the new data, and then construct the citation, citing the relevant resolution and line.  Given that there's a clear resolution explicitly stating the old ward is part of a new ward with the same name, and we have a corresponding entry in the new ward data, I'm feeling quite confident about this mapping.  I'll rate the confidence as \"high\". This is a clean and straightforward mapping.\n",
