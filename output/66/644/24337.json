  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at \"Xã Bình Thuận, Thị Xã Buôn Hồ, Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\" My primary task is to pinpoint the new administrative unit.\n\nFirst, I identified the province, \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\"  I knew I had to check for any province mergers, but in this case, the resolution confirms that the province name remains the same.  Good, one less variable to worry about.\n\nNow, focusing on \"Xã Bình Thuận,\" I delved into the relevant resolutions. Resolution `1660/NQ-UBTVQH15`, specifically targeting administrative changes within Đắk Lắk, caught my eye. Line 88 within this resolution was the key: it explicitly stated the merger of \"xã Bình Thuận\" along with others, to create the new ward \"phường Cư Bao.\"  That's a direct hit!\n\nTo be absolutely sure, I checked the `New wards` data to confirm the details. There it was: `{\"ward_code\":\"24340\",\"ward_name\":\" Phường Cư Bao\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk\"}`.  The code, name, and province all perfectly aligned with my finding.\n\nI also did a comprehensive scan of *all* other \"Bình Thuận\" mentions in the provided resolutions to ensure there was no confusion.  In all the other resolutions, \"Bình Thuận\" was either in a different context, a completely different province, or used to name *new* wards. In other words,  I found the old administrative unit (\"Xã Bình Thuận\") being reorganized, with its people and land, into the new \"Phường Cư Bao.\"\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the new ward is \"Phường Cư Bao\" with code \"24340\", confirmed by resolution  `1660/NQ-UBTVQH15`, and the province name remains \"Tỉnh Đắk Lắk.\" The confidence is high because of the explicit match in the resolution and the supporting data. I'm satisfied this is accurate.\n",
