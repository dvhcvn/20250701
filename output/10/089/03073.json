  "thought": "**Analyzing the Mapping of \"Xã Nậm Rạng\"**\n\nOkay, I'm tasked with mapping the old ward \"Xã Nậm Rạng\" to its new administrative unit, drawing from these resolutions. First, I need to thoroughly dissect the user's request: it's about translating an old administrative setup to its current counterpart. I'm focusing on \"Xã Nậm Rạng\" from \"Huyện Văn Bàn,\" \"Tỉnh Lào Cai,\" and I must cross-reference this with the given resolutions and a list of updated wards. Crucially, the solution must be presented as a properly formatted JSON array following a strict schema. The challenge is that I must sift through these documents to see if this old ward is explicitly mentioned. If I find a match, I will report the corresponding new unit and highlight my supporting evidence with its citation; otherwise, if there isn't enough information, I will mark the mapping with low confidence.\n\nThe input data shows that \"Xã Nậm Rạng\" is in the old \"Huyện Văn Bàn,\" \"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\" Resolution 60-NQ/TW tells me the province still exists, even after a merger. Now, I have to comb through the specific ward-level resolutions, like 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15, to figure out if any of the new entities match my old ward. I can see the header explicitly states that it's dealing with the reorganization of wards in Lào Cai, which is relevant. A line in this resolution is about creating a new \"Xã Văn Bàn\" out of various communes. However, it doesn't mention \"Xã Nậm Rạng.\" Since it looks like all districts were abolished, it’s most likely all the communes of Huyện Văn Bàn were reorganized. Given that the resolution explicitly names the communes that are merged, and the input commune is not listed, the chances are that the commune was reorganized in another way.\n\nI looked at resolution 1676/NQ-UBTVQH15, but it relates to a different province, Phú Thọ. It's irrelevant. I have a list of new wards with codes, names, and provinces, but unfortunately, there's no clear, direct match. There is a new \"Xã Văn Bàn\", but the resolution doesn't mention \"Xã Nậm Rạng\". There's also a \"Xã Khánh Yên\" which is interesting because of the \"Khánh Yên\" communes being merged to create the new \"Xã Văn Bàn\". The core problem here is that there's no mention of my input old ward in the data I have been given.\n\nI start to think more deeply. The old district's name and the new commune's name are the same, suggesting a reorganization, but without explicit mention, it is merely a hunch. I lack direct proof. Since the prompt states that I have access to a database, the information provided *is* the database. If it isn't in these documents, then I cannot invent it. Therefore, I will respond with an empty array because I have insufficient information.\n\nFinal Verdict: I cannot conclusively determine the new administrative unit for \"Xã Nậm Rạng\" with the given data. I'll construct a JSON array, but it will be empty since no mapping can be confidently established.\n",

I'll break it down step-by-step.\\n\\nFirst, I see the components: ward, district, and province. I know the province is \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\", so I'll start there. Based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW, the province name hasn't changed. It's still \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\".\\n\\nNext, I need to check the resolutions provided, `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Lào Cai and `1676/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Phú Thọ. Since the address is in Lào Cai, `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15` is the relevant one. This resolution clearly outlines changes within Lào Cai, particularly within Huyện Văn Bàn. It describes the merger of several wards (like \\\"thị trấn Khánh Yên\\\" and \\\"xã Khánh Yên Thượng\\\") into a new ward called \\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\".\\n\\nCrucially, \\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\" is *not* listed in this resolution. It makes it clear that other wards have been reorganized but doesn't explicitly address the fate of \\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\".\\n\\nI reviewed the \\\"new wards\\\" list and confirmed I can't determine the correct updated unit based on the provided data. The listed new wards in Lào Cai are all associated with areas listed in resolution `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15`, and \\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\" isn't mentioned.\\n\\nTherefore, given the information at hand, I can't definitively determine the current administrative unit for \\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\". More information is needed, likely another resolution or details about this specific ward's fate. My analysis reveals a change in area, with certain wards from Huyện Văn Bàn merging to form \\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\", however, this data fails to cover \\\"Xã Nậm Rạng.\\\"\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lào Cai\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Nậm Rạng, Huyện Văn Bàn, Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 7275,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0027338,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Address Mapping Dilemma: Lao Cai Edition**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I've got this Vietnamese address to decode: \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng, Huyện Văn Bàn, Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\". My goal is to figure out the corresponding new administrative unit, based on the provided resolutions and the new ward data. Here's the challenge:\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the old province and ward: \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\" respectively. Next, I dug into the resolutions, starting with Resolution 60-NQ/TW. This one confirmed that \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\" is still \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\" after some mergers with neighboring provinces. That's straightforward enough – the province name in my output is secure.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the tricky part. I needed to see if \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\" was mentioned in any of the resolutions. I scrutinized 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15, a key resolution focused on Lao Cai. It talks about creating \\\\\\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\\\\\" from various wards, but it doesn't list \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\" as one of them. This is a problem! It also doesn't mention merging wards of any district with \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\" specifically. I checked other resolutions just in case, but they turned out to be irrelevant.\\\\n\\\\nThen I moved on to the new ward data. I found entries for \\\\\\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\\\\\" in Lao Cai, confirming its existence, and I saw some other information. However, none of the data mentioned \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\" directly. The data doesn't provide enough information to resolve the issue.\\\\n\\\\nThe problem is that the given resolutions don't tell me what happened to \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\". It's possible it was merged into the new \\\\\\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\\\\\" or into something else, or that it was left as it was. Since none of the resources mention the fate of \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\", I can't confidently map it to a new ward. The fact that \\\\\\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\\\\\" is a new ward and \\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\" is not listed in the resolutions provided, creates an obstacle. The district name, \\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Bàn\\\\\\\", could hold a clue, but without more specific information, I am stuck. I need more data to provide a definitive answer.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"2.

I've got \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng, Huyện Văn Bàn, Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and I need to figure out how it translates to the new administrative units.  My initial assessment is to break it down. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" are the key components.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I checked the province resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW, to see if Lào Cai had undergone any changes.  It seems Lào Cai was merged with Yên Bái and retained the name. So, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is solid in the output. Good start.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, for the tricky part: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I dove into the resolutions, hoping for a direct match. Resolution 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15 popped up, and it was about Lào Cai.  Bingo!  But, while it details the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from a few wards, it *doesn't* mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  That's a bit frustrating.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI then went through the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is listed as a new ward, as per Resolution 1673.  I have other examples, like, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Khánh Yên\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which was merged to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The issue is the data *doesn't* list \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSince I can't find any direct information linking \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new ward based on the provided resolutions and new ward data, I'm at an impasse.  Resolution 1673 highlights that the district name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Văn Bàn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is part of the old address. It could be that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was part of that old district, and might have been merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Văn Bàn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or some other unlisted ward, or kept the old name and I don't have enough data to confirm it.  It's possible this address is simply not included in the resolutions.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nWithout further information, I can't confidently map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a new ward. I'd need to consult additional sources or datasets to verify if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nậm Rạng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was included in a larger re-organization that has not been specified in these documents.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"2.
