  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, I've got a user request to map an old administrative unit, specifically \"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải, Huyện Bảo Thắng, Tỉnh Lào Cai\", to its modern equivalent, based on some provided resolutions. My immediate task is to process this and provide a confident mapping, or indicate why I can't.\n\nFirst, I parsed the user's input: the old ward details and a set of resolutions, plus a database of new wards. I also noted that I need to provide a confidence level and source.\n\nNow, breaking down the analysis: I started by confirming the province name \"Lào Cai\" from the old ward. Checking `60-NQ/TW`, I verified that the province name itself is still valid, though the administrative boundary may have expanded by merging with Yên Bái. This is good to know, but doesn't immediately help the ward mapping.\n\nThen, I focused on the district and ward within Lào Cai. I examined the provided resolutions for mentions of \"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\" or \"Huyện Bảo Thắng\". Resolution `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Lào Cai looked promising. Scanning this resolution, it discusses amalgamating units within \"Huyện Bảo Thắng\" into a new \"xã Bảo Thắng\".  However, and this is crucial, it **doesn't** mention \"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\". It details other merging units such as \"thị trấn Phố Lu\", \"xã Sơn Hà\", \"xã Sơn Hải\", and \"xã Thái Niên\".\n\nAfter a thorough search, I can't find any information about the fate of \"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\" in the provided context. I can't correlate the old ward with any new wards because the resolutions lack relevant details. The confidence must be low, or rather, non-existent, and according to instructions, this means I need to return an empty array, `[]`. There is simply no mapping I can perform based on the user's input.\n",

First, I need to break down the information: the ward is \\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải,\\\" the district is \\\"Huyện Bảo Thắng,\\\" and the province is \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai.\\\"  The user is giving me a solid challenge.\\n\\nThe province part is easy enough to begin with. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Lào Cai merged with Yên Bái, but the new province retains the name \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\".\\n\\nNow, the trickier part is figuring out what happened at the ward and district level. I've been given a few resolutions to work with. I need to sift through these to find any specific mention of \\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\\\" or information that might shed light on its fate. I know that resolution 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically addresses ward-level changes within Lào Cai province, so that's where I need to focus.\\n\\nWithin that resolution, I found a key line describing the consolidation of \\\"thị trấn Phố Lu\\\", \\\"xã Sơn Hà\\\", \\\"xã Sơn Hải\\\", and \\\"xã Thái Niên\\\" into a new unit named \\\"Xã Bảo Thắng\\\". This is crucial. Since the request is from a user, who is looking for a comprehensive breakdown, I need to make the user fully aware that, although this resolution deals with changes in the same district, it doesn't *explicitly* mention my target, \\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải.\\\"\\n\\nI have to carefully assess whether \\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\\\" was somehow subsumed into \\\"Xã Bảo Thắng\\\" too. \\\"Xã Bảo Thắng\\\" is in the new ward list. However, because the resolution specifies the components of that ward as \\\"thị trấn Phố Lu\\\", \\\"xã Sơn Hà\\\", \\\"xã Sơn Hải\\\", and \\\"xã Thái Niên\\\", I can't definitively conclude that it's the new home for \\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\\\". There is a *possibility*, but the available text isn't definitive.  The phrasing of the resolution implies something different, the new ward is formed using these wards I've enumerated.\\n\\nI'll flag this as a potential ambiguity. I need more information to be certain. I'm going to need to tell the user that \\\"Xã Bảo Thắng\\\" is a *possible* counterpart, but I can't confirm it without additional data on the specific area consolidation plans. It's a bit frustrating because I'm used to more concrete datasets, but I need to give the best answer I can.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Lào Cai\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải, Huyện Bảo Thắng, Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 16068,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0029475,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Navigating the Administrative Unit Restructuring in Lào Cai**\\\\n\\\\nAlright, let's break this down. The user's given me an old address: \\\\\\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải, Huyện Bảo Thắng, Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\", and I need to find the new equivalent. First, I analyzed the address: it's in Phong Hải ward (specifically, Nông trường Phong Hải), Bảo Thắng district, and Lào Cai province. Easy enough.\\\\n\\\\nLào Cai merged with Yên Bái, but the name stayed the same – \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\" – so the province is consistent. No surprises there.  Now, I'm focusing on the key documents: the resolutions.  The user's given me two: `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15` (for Lào Cai) and `1678/NQ-UBTVQH15` (for Nghệ An). Clearly, I need to focus on Lào Cai.\\\\n\\\\nResolution `1673/NQ-UBTVQH15` details the rearrangement of administrative units at the commune level. Looking at the fine print, line 43 mentions merging Phố Lu, Sơn Hà, Sơn Hải, and Thái Niên into a new \\\\\\\"Xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\".  The current ward, Phong Hải, is nowhere to be seen in that list. It does give me \\\\\\\"Xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\" for Lào Cai with a ward code of 02905, but it's clearly formed from units *other* than Phong Hải.\\\\n\\\\nI can see that the new ward is in the old district of Bảo Thắng, which is why the old district name is given in the new ward name. I should also mention the other ward data in Nghệ An ({\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"16855\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Chiêu Lưu\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Nghệ An\\\\\\\"}), which is unrelated.\\\\n\\\\nBased solely on this data, I'm unable to map \\\\\\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\\\\\\\" to a new ward. The provided documents deal with different communes (Phố Lu, Sơn Hà, Sơn Hải, Thái Niên) being merged into the new \\\\\\\"Xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\". While it is *possible* that Phong Hải was incorporated into a new ward not mentioned in these documents, I have no supporting information.  The user wants the new equivalent, but with this limited context, there is no match to be made.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải, Huyện Bảo Thắng, Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 9437,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0032924999999999994,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Analysis of Administrative Unit Mapping: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tackling this address: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải, Huyện Bảo Thắng, Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  My primary goal is to map this old unit to its contemporary equivalent based on these resolutions and ward data. Let's break it down:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, the easy part:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" thanks to the province merger resolution. That's straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the tricky bit:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  The name looks slightly suspect, likely a typo or incomplete, but the core element is likely \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Phong Hải,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *within* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bảo Thắng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This is where things get interesting.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI've got Resolution 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15 from Lào Cai in my sights.  This is a critical document, as it deals with administrative changes in the exact province and region. It mentions the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Phố Lu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and several *xã*. However, *here's the rub*:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not explicitly* listed as contributing to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This is a key point to note.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe resolution **does** describe *how* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is formed. It is a cluster of wards, just not the one I am looking for.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI've also examined Resolution 1678/NQ-UBTVQH15, but it deals with Nghệ An province, so I've dismissed it. Irrelevant to my task.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the new ward data, I see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is listed, and it's confirmed as being in Lào Cai.  This supports the conclusion from the resolution that creates this new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHere's the problem I'm facing:  While \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *is* within the same district (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") and province (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Lào Cai\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn N.T Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", there's no direct statement that the old unit *became* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This lack of direct mention introduces a degree of uncertainty. It's a plausible scenario, considering the geographical proximity and context of the changes, but it's not a slam dunk.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe mapping confidence here is lower because of the direct listing issue.  Further investigation may be needed to confirm if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (or the nearby ward) was subsumed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or if it was reclassified as a different unit.  I'd need additional data or perhaps a more detailed source to pinpoint the *exact* correspondence with higher confidence.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập:\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"2.

Easy.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the main focus is on those ward-level changes within Lào Cai. Resolution 1673/NQ-UBTVQH15 catches my eye. It talks about creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from other units. Crucially, it lists \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thị trấn Phố Lu\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and some *xã* (Sơn Hà, Sơn Hải, Thái Niên), but it *doesn't* explicitly mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Phong Hải.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis is where it gets tricky. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bảo Thắng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is also within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Bảo Thắng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Logically, it seems likely that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was absorbed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or *possibly* another new unit. However, since the specific old ward is *not* directly listed in the resolution creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", the confidence of direct mapping is lowered.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI need to confirm if there are any other resolutions that explicitly cover this \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" area. I can look through other data sources that have more up-to-date data. Otherwise, I would have to make an educated guess based on location context. It appears from the provided data that the most likely mapping is to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFurthermore, I have data regarding new wards, one of which confirms the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Bảo Thắng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". It reinforces the idea that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is likely a part of this new ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nIn summary, the province remains the same, the district is unchanged and the old ward name's mapping is inconclusive based on the limited data. However, based on the location context and likely merging of units, I tentatively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị trấn Phong Hải\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to the new unit \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Bảo Thắng.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Further investigation and updated data are needed to confirm this mapping with certainty.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2.
