  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with the task of mapping an old Vietnamese address, specifically \"Xã Suối Tiên, Huyện Diên Khánh, Tỉnh Khánh Hòa,\" to its new administrative unit. My initial steps are pretty straightforward: I'll need to parse the old address to identify the old ward, district, and province. In this case, it's \"Xã Suối Tiên,\" \"Huyện Diên Khánh,\" and \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa,\" respectively.\n\nNext, I'll dive into the resolutions. First, I examine Province Resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW), but these mainly deal with province mergers and don't directly impact my target \"Xã Suối Tiên\" since Khánh Hòa is not merging. However, 60-NQ/TW does confirm that \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa\" remains unchanged as a province name, even with a hypothetical merger with Ninh Thuận.\n\nThen I look into other Resolutions, specifically 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15, the key one here that addresses the rearrangement of the units within Khánh Hòa. I'll search through it looking for my target old ward \"Xã Suối Tiên.\" Fortunately, the resolution contains the information I need. It states that \"Xã Suối Tiên,\" along with \"Bình Lộc,\" and \"Suối Hiệp,\" were merged into a new ward called \"Xã Suối Hiệp.\"\n\nArmed with this, I can extract the new ward information. The new ward's name is \"Xã Suối Hiệp,\" and the province remains \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa.\" Now, to verify this, I'll check my \"New wards\" data. I'm looking for \"Xã Suối Hiệp\" within \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa,\" and lo and behold, it's there, confirmed by code \"22702.\"\n\nWith everything verified, I'll construct my JSON output. The province is \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa,\" the new ward is \"Xã Suối Hiệp\" with code \"22702,\" and the confidence level is high because I have direct evidence in the resolution. As for the citation, I'll cite the relevant line from resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifying that the three aforementioned wards were merged into the new ward, \"Xã Suối Hiệp.\" This gives me a complete and confident mapping!\n",
