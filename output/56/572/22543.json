  "thought": "**Analysis of Administrative Unit Change for \"Phường Ninh Hải, Thị xã Ninh Hòa, Tỉnh Khánh Hòa\"**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. First, I identified the key components of the old address: \"Phường Ninh Hải\" (ward) and \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa\" (province).  My immediate task is to confirm if any adjustments have been made to these units.  I'm focusing on finding the new ward corresponding to the old \"Phường Ninh Hải.\"\n\nThe province, \"Tỉnh Khánh Hòa,\" appears straightforward. A quick check of Resolution 60-NQ/TW shows that Khánh Hòa remains intact after potential mergers.  So, no need to worry about the province name changing.\n\nNow, the crucial part: finding the new ward for \"Phường Ninh Hải.\"  I moved through the relevant resolutions, specifically targeting those for Khánh Hòa. Resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 looked promising.  Line 37 mentioned a \"xã Ninh Hải,\" but I quickly recognized the discrepancy. My input is \"Phường Ninh Hải,\" a *phường*, not a *xã*. Different types of administrative units, therefore this line is not directly relevant to my task.\n\nScanning further, I hit paydirt on line 58 of the same resolution: it explicitly stated that \"phường Ninh Hải\" was being merged into a new unit named \"phường Đông Ninh Hòa\". Bingo! This is a perfect match – the old ward type and the old name are explicitly mentioned as being subsumed into the new ward.  This is a direct match, precisely what I was looking for.\n\nTo solidify my analysis, I checked the \"New Wards\" data. Finding \"phường Đông Ninh Hòa\" with the ward code \"22561\" confirmed the match.\n\nThe other line from the resolution, line 37, deals with the merging of *xã* units, and specifically mentions the creation of \"xã Ninh Hải\". This is important to distinguish as a different process that isn't connected to the \"Phường Ninh Hải\" being considered in the current address. The input is \"Phường Ninh Hải\", and line 58 clearly addresses it.\n\nTherefore, the new administrative unit for \"Phường Ninh Hải\" is \"phường Đông Ninh Hòa.\" My citation will include the exact line from Resolution 1667/NQ-UBTVQH15 that supports this conclusion, ensuring full transparency in my findings. I'm very confident in this outcome due to the specific and direct mention within the resolution.\n",
