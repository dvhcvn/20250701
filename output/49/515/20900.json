  "thought": "**Processing Administrative Unit Mapping Request**\n\nOkay, here's how I'm thinking through this. I've got a request to map an old administrative unit to its current counterpart based on some resolutions provided. My starting point is `Xã Trà Sơn, Huyện Bắc Trà My, Tỉnh Quảng Nam`. I need to figure out which *new* ward(s) this has been merged into, keeping in mind I have several resolutions (60-NQ/TW, 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, and 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15) and a list of new wards.  The goal is a JSON array output, with confidence levels and resolution citations.\n\nFirst, I break down the old unit. It's `Xã Trà Sơn` in `Huyện Bắc Trà My`, part of `Tỉnh Quảng Nam`. Straightforward.  Now the real work begins. I've got to analyze these resolutions.\n\nThe province-level resolution, 60-NQ/TW, is the crucial first step.  It states a merger:  \"Hợp nhất tỉnh Quảng Nam và thành phố Đà Nẵng, lấy tên là thành phố Đà Nẵng.\" (Merge Quang Nam province and Da Nang city, taking the name Da Nang city). This completely changes the landscape! The old `Tỉnh Quảng Nam` is now part of `Thành phố Đà Nẵng`. This has huge implications – I need to be searching within Da Nang now, not Quảng Nam.\n\nI move onto the other resolutions, focusing on Da Nang. Resolution 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically addresses \"Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Đà Nẵng.\" (Arranging commune-level administrative units of Da Nang city).  This is perfect! Line 43 in this resolution is the key.  It reads \"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của thị trấn Trà My và các xã Trà Sơn, Trà Giang, Trà Dương thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Trà My**.\"  (Arrange the entire natural area, population size of Tra My town and the communes of Tra Son, Tra Giang, Tra Duong into a new commune named **Tra My commune**.) Bingo! The direct match I need. `Xã Trà Sơn` is clearly mentioned as merging into `xã Trà My`, within the Da Nang arrangement.  This looks promising.\n\nNow, I look at the other resolution, 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15. It's about units in Quảng Ngãi. And there it is again, a `xã Trà Sơn` mentioned! But this is in a completely different context: \"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của thị trấn Trà Xuân, xã Trà Sơn và xã Trà Thủy thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Trà Bồng**.\" (Arrange the entire natural area, population size of Tra Xuan town, Tra Son commune, and Tra Thuy commune into a new commune named **Tra Bong commune**.)  Ah, this makes me pause.  Is this the *same* `Xã Trà Sơn`?  It can't be -  the input is from Quảng Nam, not Quảng Ngãi. I have to look more closely.\n\nYes, it clicks. The resolution mentions `thị trấn Trà Xuân`, which is the district town of `Huyện Trà Bồng` in `Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi`.  That confirms this is *not* the `Xã Trà Sơn` I'm looking for. The input ward is in `Bắc Trà My`. The Da Nang resolution, 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, mentions `thị trấn Trà My`, the district town of `Bắc Trà My`. So it's clearly the relevant match. There must be two communes named `Trà Sơn`, one in each province. So I can safely disregard resolution 1677 here.\n\nTherefore, my final conclusion: Based on resolution 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, `Xã Trà Sơn, Huyện Bắc Trà My, Tỉnh Quảng Nam` has been merged into **`Xã Trà My`**.  High confidence, given the clear resolution reference and the analysis of overlapping names.\n",

I need to break this down into \\\"ward\\\", \\\"district\\\", and \\\"province\\\".\\n    *   The crucial part is the provided resolutions: `60-NQ/TW` (for provincial mergers), `1659/NQ-UBTVQH15` and `1677/NQ-UBTVQH15` (for ward-level changes), plus a list of new wards with their details.\\n    *   My objective?

So, the province has changed.\\n    *   **Ward Next:** Now, I look at the ward-level resolutions for `Xã Trà Sơn`.\\n        *   Resolution `1659/NQ-UBTVQH15` is a direct hit!

My goal is to determine the new administrative unit corresponding to the old address: Xã Trà Sơn, Huyện Bắc Trà My, Tỉnh Quảng Nam.  I'll be using the provided resolutions and the new ward list.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, the inputs are straightforward: Xã Trà Sơn (ward), Huyện Bắc Trà My (district), and Tỉnh Quảng Nam (province).\\\\n\\\\nNow, the province resolution (60-NQ/TW) is key.  Initially, Quảng Nam isn't on the \\\\\\\"no change\\\\\\\" list.  Digging deeper into the merger list, I see that Quảng Nam merged with Đà Nẵng to become \\\\\\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\\\\\". That's my starting point for a province change.\\\\n\\\\nMoving to other resolutions, I'm specifically looking for references to \\\\\\\"Xã Trà Sơn.\\\\\\\" Resolution 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning Đà Nẵng, is promising. It describes combining several wards, including Trà Sơn, into a new ward: \\\\\\\"xã Trà My.\\\\\\\"  And critically, this resolution is for \\\\\\\"thành phố Đà Nẵng,\\\\\\\" the new province derived from the merger. Perfect!\\\\n\\\\nHowever, I also found resolution 1677/NQ-UBTVQH15, related to Quảng Ngãi, which also mentions \\\\\\\"Xã Trà Sơn.\\\\\\\" Here, the old ward, along with others, is reorganized to form \\\\\\\"xã Trà Bồng.\\\\\\\" The problem is this resolution is about Quảng Ngãi. My original province, Quảng Nam, *became* Đà Nẵng, not Quảng Ngãi. Although the prompt calls to include *all* candidates, this is a much lower probability due to the province mismatch.\\\\n\\\\nNow, I'll cross-reference these findings with the provided new ward data.  I'm looking for \\\\\\\"xã Trà My\\\\\\\" in Đà Nẵng, and I found `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"20900\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Trà My\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\\\\\"}`. This confirms the Đà Nẵng association.\\\\n\\\\nFor \\\\\\\"xã Trà Bồng,\\\\\\\" I find `{\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"21115\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Bồng\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\"}`. The name matches, but the province, Quảng Ngãi, is a clear inconsistency with the Quảng Nam -> Đà Nẵng merger.\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, I'm confident about \\\\\\\"Xã Trà Sơn\\\\\\\" in the old administrative structure mapping to \\\\\\\"Xã Trà My\\\\\\\" in the new structure under \\\\\\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng.\\\\\\\"  While \\\\\\\"xã Trà Bồng\\\\\\\" is a possible match based on a resolution, the province discrepancy greatly diminishes the confidence in that match. Therefore, my primary recommendation is the mapping to \\\\\\\"xã Trà My\\\\\\\" in Đà Nẵng.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Quảng Nam và thành phố Đà Nẵng, lấy tên là thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"high\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"20900\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Trà My\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"1659/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"43.

First, I extracted the key components from the input: *Xã Trà Sơn* (ward), *Huyện Bắc Trà My* (district), and *Tỉnh Quảng Nam* (province).  Now, the goal is to map this old address to a new administrative unit based on these resolutions and the new ward list.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe initial step is always province-level.  I checked the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list, and *Tỉnh Quảng Nam* wasn't there. Then I looked at the merger list.  Bingo!  The resolution *60-NQ/TW* tells me that Quảng Nam merged with Đà Nẵng to become *Thành phố Đà Nẵng*. So, my new target province is Đà Nẵng.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I dove into the resolutions to find details about *Xã Trà Sơn*.  Resolution *1659/NQ-UBTVQH15* jumps out. It's about Đà Nẵng, which is already a positive sign. This resolution says that *Xã Trà Sơn*, along with some other wards, will form a new ward called *Xã Trà My*.  The resolution's heading confirms this is related to *Thành phố Đà Nẵng*, making it a strong contender.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI also found another resolution, *1677/NQ-UBTVQH15*, mentioning *Xã Trà Sơn*.  It indicates a merger into a new ward named *Xã Trà Bồng*. However, this resolution is for *Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi*, which doesn't align with Quảng Nam's merger into Đà Nẵng. Therefore, this one is much less likely to be relevant, but I should still keep it in mind.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow I need to see if the new wards are actually in the provided list.  I find *{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"20900\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà My\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}*. This perfectly matches the *Xã Trà My* from the Đà Nẵng resolution.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI also find *{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"21115\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Trà Bồng\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"}* for *Xã Trà Bồng*.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, where does that leave me? I'm highly confident that *Xã Trà Sơn* is now *Xã Trà My* in *Thành phố Đà Nẵng*.  The province change fits perfectly, and the resolution is clear about it. The *Xã Trà Bồng* match is possible, but it is of much lower confidence because it's associated with *Tỉnh Quảng Ngãi*. I would mark the *Xã Trà Bồng* mapping with a note about the province mismatch.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Quảng Nam và thành phố Đà Nẵng, lấy tên là thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"20900\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Trà My\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1659/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"43.
