  "thought": "**Navigating the Administrative Unit Shift in Quảng Nam**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. The user is asking me to trace an old address, \"Xã Tà Bhinh, Huyện Nam Giang, Tỉnh Quảng Nam,\" to its new administrative unit. My expertise in these matters is going to be helpful here.\n\nFirst, I identified the old province and ward: Tỉnh Quảng Nam and Xã Tà Bhinh, respectively.  I immediately noted that Quảng Nam is now part of Thành phố Đà Nẵng, based on Resolution 60-NQ/TW.\n\nNow, my task is to find the *new* ward that corresponds to Xã Tà Bhinh. I'm going through the provided resolutions, specifically looking for any mention of \"Xã Tà Bhinh\" or \"Nam Giang\" (the old district).\n\nThe provided resolutions are about mergers into *new* wards. I'm focusing on the *input* components of these mergers, since the input components of the new wards would be the old wards.\n\n1659/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Đà Nẵng) caught my attention. It creates \"Xã Nam Giang\" from \"xã Zuôih\" and \"xã Chà Vàl.\"  The key observation is that while the new ward is named \"Nam Giang,\" reflecting the old district, *Xã Tà Bhinh* isn't listed as a contributing component.  The resolution explicitly states *only* \"Zuôih\" and \"Chà Vàl\" form the new \"Xã Nam Giang\".  I need to re-evaluate the prompt: to go through each resolution and find *one* or multiple wards that may be the new administrative unit corresponding to the given address. The prompt seems to imply only the ward. Although the district name appears in the new ward name, the old ward name \"Xã Tà Bhinh\" is *not* mentioned in the input of the resolution, and it's stated that only two wards form the new one. So, I would conclude at this point that Xã Tà Bhinh is *not* part of this new \"Xã Nam Giang.\"\n\nThe other resolutions, 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Lâm Đồng) and 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Ninh Bình), are irrelevant, with no mentions of \"Tà Bhinh\" or \"Nam Giang.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the provided resolutions, I *cannot* definitively map \"Xã Tà Bhinh\" to a new administrative unit. Although \"Nam Giang\" is a strong *hint* due to the naming, it's not a match with the current information. I need more data to be certain. Perhaps I need additional resolutions or different information to precisely determine the new administrative unit for Xã Tà Bhinh. I need to be sure before I make any definitive conclusions in this case.\n",
