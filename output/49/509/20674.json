  "thought": "**Understanding the Address Transformation: A Deep Dive**\n\nOkay, here's what I've got. The user needs the updated administrative unit for the old address \"Xã Quế Phước, Huyện Quế Sơn, Tỉnh Quảng Nam.\" My first step, as always, is to break down the information: ward, district, and province. Then, I need to understand how the administrative structure has changed.\n\nI know there's been some provincial restructuring, so I immediately went looking for that information. I know Quảng Nam merged with Đà Nẵng, which gave me my initial direction: \"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\" is now the relevant province. Then, I dug into resolution 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, which specifically deals with changes in Đà Nẵng's administrative divisions.\n\nThis is where things get interesting. I scanned the resolution for the old ward \"Quế Phước.\"  Line 59 jumped out at me:  it details the *creation* of a *new* \"xã Quế Phước\" by merging \"Quế Lâm,\" \"Phước Ninh,\" and \"Ninh Phước.\"  Wait a minute... that's a key detail! The user is looking for a *new* address for an *old* \"Xã Quế Phước.\" This resolution describes the *formation* of a new ward with that name, not what happens to an old one. It seems like the user's initial setup of the question is not completely clear here.\n\nThis made me pause and re-evaluate. I have the old ward, \"Xã Quế Phước\" and the resolution describes a *new* \"Xã Quế Phước\" as the result of a merger. The information clearly states `{\"ward_code\":\"20669\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Quế Phước\",\"province_name\":\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\"}`. So,  the  \"Xã Quế Phước\" in the user's input  is  now part of \"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\" . The resolution specifies exactly how the *new* ward is formed. The key is to understand that the input ward name \"Xã Quế Phước\" is an old name, and the new \"Xã Quế Phước\" comes from the merger.\nMy dilemma is that I don't see how the old  \"Xã Quế Phước\" is handled in the merger,  and the input is clearly about that old ward, not one of the merging wards. I need to clarify if there's been a misunderstanding in how the user described the task.\n",

I've got the necessary resolutions and a list of new wards to work with. Let's break down my thought process:\\n\\nFirst, I identified the old province, \\\"Tỉnh Quảng Nam.\\\"  Easy enough, resolution 60-NQ/TW tells me it's now part of \\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\". So far, so good.\\n\\nNow for the tricky part: \\\"Xã Quế Phước.\\\"  I dove into the \\\"Other resolutions,\\\" specifically resolution 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, looking for any mention of it. Line 59 caught my eye: it describes a *new* \\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\" being formed from the merger of Quế Lâm, Phước Ninh, and Ninh Phước. Here's where it gets complicated.\\n\\nThe *old* address has \\\"Xã Quế Phước.\\\" This resolution is creating a *new* one. The language is very specific: \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các xã Quế Lâm, Phước Ninh và Ninh Phước thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Quế Phước**.\\\" Crucially, it doesn't say that the *old* \\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\" (from the original address) is being merged, renamed, or otherwise affected.\\n\\nI reread that section multiple times to be absolutely sure. The resolution *creates* a new \\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\" from those other wards. It does *not* imply that the *old* \\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\" is being absorbed or renamed.\\n\\nThis is a problem. The prompt asks me to find a new ward corresponding to the old one. If it's not explicitly mentioned in the resolutions as being changed, then what's my citation?  The structure requires a citation.\\n\\nCould it be that the *new* \\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\" formed from the three is *intended* to replace the old? The resolution *doesn't say that*. It's *creating* a *new* one. I have to stick to the facts presented in the resolutions.\\n\\nThe key is this: based on *only* the provided resolutions, the *old* \\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\" in the address isn't explicitly addressed. The resolution *creates* a *new* one, but doesn't map the old one.  Given the prompt, it would seem that the old \\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\" in the address is not explicitly handled by the provided resolutions. Therefore, I can't definitively determine its corresponding new unit solely from this data. This is a critical point that needs further investigation with potentially different resolutions.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\",\n        \"line\": \"Hợp nhất tỉnh Quảng Nam và thành phố Đà Nẵng, lấy tên là thành phố Đà Nẵng\"\n      },\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"20669\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Quế Phước\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Quế Phước, Huyện Quế Sơn, Tỉnh Quảng Nam\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 9036,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0027854,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Analysis of Vietnamese Administrative Unit Mapping**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm tackling this Vietnamese address: \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước, Huyện Quế Sơn, Tỉnh Quảng Nam\\\\\\\" and trying to find its current equivalent based on the provided resolutions. My initial approach is straightforward: I'll break down the address component by component. First, I see \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Quảng Nam,\\\\\\\" which I immediately understand needs checking against the province resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nSure enough, resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Quảng Nam and Đà Nẵng merged, becoming \\\\\\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\\\\\". So, I have my first mapping: the province is now Đà Nẵng. That was easy enough.\\\\n\\\\nNext up is the ward, \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\\\\\". This is where things get a bit more interesting. I'm focusing on the \\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\" and searching for mentions of \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước.\\\\\\\"  Specifically, I'm analyzing Resolution 1659/NQ-UBTVQH15, looking for any information on changes to \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nLine 59 of that resolution mentions \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước,\\\\\\\" but it's not quite what I expected. The resolution describes the formation of a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\\\\\" from the merger of Quế Lâm, Phước Ninh, and Ninh Phước. Here's the critical point: the *old* \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\\\\\" from the input address *isn't* explicitly mentioned in this merger or any renaming activities. It creates a new entity.\\\\n\\\\nI'm carefully re-reading the resolution, thinking about the implications.  It states a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\\\\\" is formed *from* those other three, but it doesn't say the *old* one, the one in my input address, is *part of* that formation. It also doesn't say if the name is moved or maintained.\\\\n\\\\nThis is a real challenge. I need to figure out how to map the *old* \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước.\\\\\\\" The provided instructions are clear: \\\\\\\"Go through each resolution, identify whether the ward in the address is mentioned. Find one or multiple new ward that may be the new administrative unit corresponding to the given address.\\\\\\\" I have to find a corresponding new unit.\\\\n\\\\nI'm realizing that based *strictly* on these resolutions, the *old* \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly accounted for. The resolution creates a *new* one, but that's a different entity.  The prompt's wording (\\\\\\\"may be the new administrative unit\\\\\\\") does offer some wiggle room, but I can't definitively state that the *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\\\\\" is the correct match without more evidence, since the resolutions don't directly handle the *old* one from the input address. My schema needs me to cite resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nIt's tempting to assume a connection between the old and new names, but I can't make that leap without clear evidence. Therefore, based on the provided information, I can't give a definitive new ward for the given \\\\\\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Quảng Nam và thành phố Đà Nẵng, lấy tên là thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Thành phố Đà Nẵng\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"20669\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Quế Phước\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\"\n}"
