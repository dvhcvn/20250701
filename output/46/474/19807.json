  "thought": "**Navigating the Administrative Restructuring**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My task is to determine the new administrative unit corresponding to \"Phường Thuỷ Biều, Quận Thuận Hóa, Thành phố Huế.\" First, I need to analyze the input. We've got the old ward, district, and province/city. Based on the provided prompt and my understanding of Vietnamese administrative restructuring, all districts are being eliminated. That means Quận Thuận Hóa is gone. The prompt also notes that most wards are being renamed, split, or merged, but a small number remain unchanged. I need to figure out what happened to Phường Thuỷ Biều.\n\nNow, let's review the resolutions.  I'm focusing on province-level changes first. The 60-NQ/TW resolution states that \"Thành phố Huế\" isn't being merged. Excellent, that's straightforward. So, Thành phố Huế remains the province.\n\nThe district, Quận Thuận Hóa, is eliminated based on the prompt's instruction that all districts will be eliminated.\n\nHere's the tricky part: wards. There's no specific information on what happens to \"Phường Thuỷ Biều.\" The document doesn't provide a list of new wards, and no 'Other Resolutions' or 'New wards' sections exist.\n\nPutting this all together, I can confidently say that Thành phố Huế remains the province. However, I have absolutely no information about the new name or code (if any) for Phường Thuỷ Biều. It could be renamed, merged, split, or even remain unchanged. Since I can't definitively map the old ward to a new one, my confidence is low.\n\nTherefore, the output will be a JSON object containing the province name \"Thành phố Huế,\" supported by the relevant citation. The ward-related fields (\"ward_name\" and \"ward_code\") will be omitted because they're unknown. My final answer reflects my uncertainty about the specific ward-level changes.\n",

Let's break this down. First, I need to analyze the input: \\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều\\\" (the ward), \\\"Quận Thuận Hóa\\\" (the district), and \\\"Thành phố Huế\\\" (the province/city).  I understand this is a fairly recent set of changes.\\n\\nNow, looking at the resolutions. I know that according to Resolution 60-NQ/TW, \\\"Thành phố Huế\\\" itself isn't being merged or changed at the province-level. It remains \\\"Thành phố Huế\\\". That's a solid start. As for districts, the prompt tells me that districts are being eliminated in this restructuring. So \\\"Quận Thuận Hóa\\\" is gone.\\n\\nThe tricky part is the ward-level information. While the prompt says that wards are often renamed, split, or merged, I have *no* specific information about \\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều.\\\" The \\\"Other resolutions\\\" and \\\"New wards\\\" sections are completely empty. Essentially, I'm missing the critical details to pinpoint what happened to this particular ward.\\n\\nTherefore, I can confidently state that the province remains \\\"Thành phố Huế.\\\" However, I cannot determine the new name or code for \\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều\\\". My confidence here is *low* because of this lack of information. I *can* cite the resolution that solidifies the province name: \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\" specifically points to \\\"Thành phố Huế\\\".\\n\\nFinally, constructing the JSON output is straightforward.  I'll include \\\"Thành phố Huế\\\" as the `province_name`,  I’ll omit the unknown ward information, set the `confidence` to \\\"low,\\\" and include the necessary `citation`. It is important to wrap the object in an array as the request requires a JSON array as a format of output.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập\",\n        \"line\": \"2.

My task is to find the new ward(s) that encompass this old one, understanding that Vietnamese administrative restructuring has been underway, with resolutions like 60-NQ/TW impacting how things are organized. My output needs to be in a JSON array following a specific schema.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user has explicitly stated that districts are being eliminated and wards are either renamed, split, or merged. I've also been given a few resolutions to examine. \\\\n\\\\nBased on my analysis of resolution 60-NQ/TW, it seems Thành phố Huế is *not* a province that has been merged. That helps, because that means the province, at least, should be the same. \\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\" remains \\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\". Other resolutions that might have dealt with ward-level changes are empty.\\\\n\\\\nNow, focusing on the old ward itself: Phường Thuỷ Biều, Quận Thuận Hóa, Thành phố Huế. Since districts are eliminated, Quận Thuận Hóa no longer exists.  Phường Thuỷ Biều now falls directly under the province. The user's prompt also states, \\\\\\\"Most of the wards have been renamed / split or merged. A small number of the wards are kept unchanged.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nThe trouble is, I have no specific information about what happened to Phường Thuỷ Biều. There are no resolutions, no \\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\" list, nothing to definitively say whether it was renamed, merged, or remained unchanged. In the absence of contrary information, I am forced to make the weakest assumption - that it kept its name. The fact that the user stated \\\\\\\"Most of the wards have been renamed / split or merged. A small number of the wards are kept unchanged,\\\\\\\" adds additional uncertainty.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, because of this uncertainty and lack of specific data, I must set the confidence level to \\\\\\\"low.\\\\\\\" My best guess, based on the information I have, is that the ward is still called \\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều\\\\\\\", but now it's directly under \\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\". It's the most *likely* scenario given the prompt, but I can't be confident in it.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập: 2.

The task is to identify the new administrative unit for the address: `Phường Thuỷ Biều, Quận Thuận Hóa, Thành phố Huế`. Based on my analysis, I've got a pretty good grasp of the provincial situation, but the specifics of the ward are a bit murky.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I examined the province and district resolutions. The province, `Thành phố Huế`, seems to have retained its status based on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" resolution (specifically item 2, which lists provinces *not* undergoing mergers). So, that's straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe district, `Quận Thuận Hóa`, is a different story. The instructions explicitly state that all districts are being eliminated, so that's been wiped off the map, as expected.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, the trickier part: the ward, `Phường Thuỷ Biều`. The prompt mentions that most wards have been renamed, split, or merged. However, the provided resolutions offer no specific information about what happened to this particular ward in Huế. The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" sections are completely empty.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nGiven the lack of specific ward-level information, I'm left with the unavoidable conclusion that I can't definitively determine the new ward name or code. It *could* have been renamed, merged, split, or even kept the same. However, without any supporting documentation, I can't confidently assert any of these scenarios.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTherefore, the most honest response is to acknowledge the uncertainty. While I can confirm the province name, `Thành phố Huế`, based on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" resolution, I have no reliable information on the ward's fate. I'll flag my confidence as low because of this critical information gap. My output will reflect the province name and a low confidence rating. There will be no ward name or code, as I have no valid reason to provide them. The citation for the province name will be \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều, Quận Thuận Hóa, Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8435,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0024633,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**My Analysis of the Vietnamese Address Mapping**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with the task of mapping this old Vietnamese address, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều, Quận Thuận Hóa, Thành phố Huế,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to its modern administrative equivalent.  My first step is always to break down the address: I've got \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the ward, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quận Thuận Hóa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the district, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as the province (or city).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe key here is understanding the context: the prompt mentions eliminating districts and that wards are likely renamed, split, or merged. However, I have no specific resolutions to guide me.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI immediately check resolution 60-NQ/TW, specifically for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Good news there! It's explicitly stated that Huế remains unchanged at the province level. That's a high-confidence mapping – the province stays the same.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I look for any other resolutions or new ward data, but both are empty arrays.  No specific information! This is where it gets tricky. I'm left with a general statement that wards are mostly changing, but *no* data on how \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" might have been affected.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe schema requires `citation`, `confidence`, `province_name`, `ward_code`, `ward_name`.  I have the citation (60-NQ/TW), the province name (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"), but I'm completely in the dark on the new ward. The prompt tells me to include possible candidates even if I'm not sure. But since I lack information about *new* wards, the only candidate is the original, but that’s with very low confidence. The districts being removed also support the low confidence, and I can't definitively map the old district to a new equivalent.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nSo, I have to be incredibly careful. I *cannot* definitively state the new ward, as I have absolutely no evidence. It could have changed, or it might not. My only choice is to indicate low confidence and a potential, unverified, candidate (the original ward) to satisfy the instruction to include \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"possible candidates.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This isn't ideal, but it's the most accurate representation of the information I *do* have.  I need to clearly communicate the uncertainty due to the data gaps. I’ll make sure the response reflects the lack of supporting information regarding specific ward changes, and therefore the low confidence.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2.

Let's break down my thought process:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the initial address. I've identified the ward as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" the district as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quận Thuận Hóa,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and the province as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" The prompt also clarifies that all districts are being eliminated, so Quận Thuận Hóa is no longer valid as a distinct unit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I consult the provided resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW, to see if any changes apply to Thành phố Huế. Thankfully, it's explicitly stated that Huế remains unchanged at the province level. That gives me high confidence in the province mapping.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nHowever, things get tricky when it comes to the wards and the former district. There are no specific resolutions for them, nor any \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" array. The \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" array is also empty, offering no additional guidance.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe provided information states that most wards have been renamed, split, or merged, but, crucially, there is no information on how that applies to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Biều\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" specifically. The elimination of districts further complicates the situation, as Quận Thuận Hóa no longer exists.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBased on the schema requirements, I have to provide a `citation`, `confidence`, `province_name`, `ward_code`, and `ward_name`. I can confidently confirm the province and should assign a high confidence level for this. However, since no new ward information is given, I can only state that it *could* be the original ward, but that I have a low confidence level about that, as this is speculative due to the lack of specific information.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nConsequently, the most accurate output reflects my uncertainty regarding the ward mapping, given the lack of specific resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"2.
