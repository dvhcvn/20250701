  "thought": "**Determining the New Administrative Unit for Phường Thuỷ Xuân**\n\nOkay, let's break this down. My goal is to figure out the new administrative unit for \"Phường Thuỷ Xuân, Quận Thuận Hóa, Thành phố Huế.\" First, I need to analyze the information given: we're dealing with an old ward (\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\"), an old district (\"Quận Thuận Hóa\"), and an old province/city (\"Thành phố Huế\").\n\nThe provided resolutions are key. 60-NQ/TW tells us about province-level changes. \"Thành phố Huế\" is explicitly listed as a province *not* being merged, so that part's easy. It stays \"Thành phố Huế.\" The prompt also states that districts are being eliminated, meaning \"Quận Thuận Hóa\" no longer exists. Wards now fall directly under the city.\n\nNow comes the tricky part: the ward itself. The prompt says wards are mostly renamed, split, or merged, but some stay the same. I've got to check the \"Other resolutions\" and \"New wards\" sections for information on \"Phường Thuỷ Xuân.\" Both sections are empty. Nothing specifically mentions a change for this ward.\n\nSynthesizing all of this, here's what I *know*: \"Thành phố Huế\" remains unchanged. \"Quận Thuận Hóa\" is gone. I have *no* specific information about \"Phường Thuỷ Xuân.\" It *could* have been renamed, merged, split, or kept the same.\n\nTherefore, since there's no evidence of a change, the most reasonable assumption is that \"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\" *also* remains unchanged, but now falls directly under \"Thành phố Huế.\" Thus, a potential new unit is \"Phường Thuỷ Xuân, Thành phố Huế.\" However, because this is an *assumption* based on the absence of information, I have to be clear about my low confidence level.\n\nConsequently, my JSON output will be structured as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"citation\": {\n      \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW\",\n      \"line\": \"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập: 2. Thành phố Huế\"\n    },\n    \"confidence\": \"low\",\n    \"province_name\": \"Thành phố Huế\",\n    \"ward_code\": null,\n    \"ward_name\": \"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThe province name is confirmed. The ward name is an informed guess due to a lack of data. No ward code can be determined. My confidence in the result is low, which is crucial to note. This reflects the uncertain nature of the solution given the provided information.\n",

Crucially, resolution 60-NQ/TW states that \\\"Thành phố Huế\\\" won't be merged with any other province. Excellent, that's straightforward. So, the province remains \\\"Thành phố Huế.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, the directive is that districts are eliminated. Therefore, \\\"Quận Thuận Hóa\\\" is out of the picture.  Ward-level changes are a mixed bag - some renamed, split, merged, or kept unchanged, with no clear indication of a single directive. I've got to investigate the \\\"Other resolutions\\\" and \\\"New wards\\\" sections. Unfortunately, they're both empty.\\n\\nThis is where things get tricky. I have no specific information regarding how \\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\\\" was affected. Did it merge? Split? Get a new name? No way to tell from the information at hand. There are no provided resolutions that state the new ward.\\n\\nMy conclusion? While I *know* the province is unchanged (\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\"), I can't confidently identify the new ward or its code. My confidence is low, and I must indicate that. Resolution 60-NQ/TW provides information that states Huế isn't merging. This leads to the JSON structure I am prepared to return.  I'm unable to provide more definitive information based on what I have available.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập:\",\n        \"line\": \"2.

The information suggests province-level changes, specifically Resolution 60-NQ/TW. Aha, it specifically mentions Huế (\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\") in the list of provinces *not* undergoing mergers. Excellent! So, that confirms the province is still \\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nMoving down, it's clear all districts are being eliminated – a pretty sweeping change. That means \\\\\\\"Quận Thuận Hóa\\\\\\\" is gone.\\\\n\\\\nNow, for the ward level, things are a little trickier. The prompt says wards are mostly renamed, split, or merged, with a small number remaining unchanged. I don't have any specific resolutions for Huế that detail the changes to \\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân.\\\\\\\" The \\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\" sections are both empty. That makes it challenging.\\\\n\\\\nPutting it all together, I can confirm the province is \\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế,\\\\\\\" but the fate of \\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\\\\\\\" remains unclear. Since there's no specific information on the ward changes for Huế, I can't determine the new ward name or code. My confidence level on the ward level is low, because I need more data.\\\\n\\\\nI'll put together the output with what I've got. It will be a JSON object with:\\\\n\\\\n*   `province_name`: \\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\"\\\\n*   `confidence`: \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\"\\\\n*   `citation`: \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập: 2.

The user's request is to find the updated administrative unit for the address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân, Quận Thuận Hóa, Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" given that there's a restructuring initiative.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I identified the components: the ward (Phường Thuỷ Xuân), the district (Quận Thuận Hóa), and the province/city (Thành phố Huế). I know that provinces aren't being merged based on resolution 60-NQ/TW, which specifically lists Huế as remaining.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I reviewed the available documentation. I have the province-level resolutions (60-NQ/TW), but they don't give any ward-specific information. There's also no data in \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe user mentioned that all districts are being eliminated and wards are either renamed, split, merged, or kept unchanged. Knowing this, I need to focus on identifying what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUnfortunately, the available resolutions only cover province-level changes. There's nothing about specific wards, or anything in the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to help.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo, here's what I *can* determine: Huế remains \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on the 60-NQ/TW resolution. However, I have *no* information about what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Whether it's been renamed, merged, split, or remained unchanged is unknown with the data I have.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThus, my response must reflect the uncertainty. I'll construct a JSON object containing the province name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" with a low confidence level and cite resolution 60-NQ/TW for the province's status. I'll omit the ward code and ward name since I can't determine them based on available information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```json\\\\\\\\n[\\\\\\\\n  {\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh không thực hiện sáp nhập: 2.

Given my expertise in administrative restructuring, I immediately zero in on the key challenge: the district level is being eliminated. This means \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quận Thuận Hóa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is gone, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" likely falls under a new, larger structure.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI start by examining the provided resolutions.  The province, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is addressed first.  Resolution 60-NQ/TW explicitly states that this province \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (is not merged).  Therefore, I'm confident that the province remains unchanged; \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" it is.  *Citation: 60-NQ/TW*. Confidence: High.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, the tricky part: the ward.  The prompt explicitly states that most wards have been renamed, split, or merged. However, the database I'm given has empty sections for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  I was hoping for specifics on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but alas, nothing. This leaves me in a bit of a bind.  The elimination of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quận Thuận Hóa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" suggests \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will be absorbed, but into what?  Without any ward-level resolutions, I can't pinpoint a new ward name or code.  The prompt emphasizes finding *all possible* candidates, but based on the provided data, there are *no* valid candidates.  The situation is clear: the data is insufficient for that determination. Confidence: Low.

The user is asking me to translate this old Vietnamese address into its new administrative structure, based on the provided resolutions. I need to break down \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân, Quận Thuận Hóa, Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into province, district, and ward. Based on the address, it is clear:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **Province:** Thành phố Huế (Hue City)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **District:** Quận Thuận Hóa (Thuan Hoa District) - but I know from the instructions that districts are being eliminated.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n*   **Ward:** Phường Thuỷ Xuân (Thuy Xuan Ward)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I checked the province resolutions to see if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" had been merged. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that it *is not* to be merged (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"không thực hiện sáp nhập\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"). So, the province name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" remains unchanged. I'm confident about that.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, for the tricky part: the ward. The prompt says that most wards have been renamed, split, or merged. However, the provided database of resolutions doesn't have any specific information about \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quận Thuận Hóa.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Neither the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" nor the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" sections contain any relevant data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nBecause the districts are being eliminated, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Quận Thuận Hóa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will no longer exist. I'm assuming that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Thuỷ Xuân\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will either fall directly under \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" or be part of a new, larger ward *within* Thành phố Huế. However, since I don't have the specific resolutions that would tell me *which* new ward it belongs to, I can't provide a definite new ward name or code.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, while I can confidently map the province, I have very low confidence in providing a new ward mapping. The lack of specific ward-level information prevents me from confidently identifying the new ward. The schemas needed are citation, confidence, province name, ward code and ward name. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is my citation for the province, but I do not have a citation for the ward, thus my conclusion is low-confidence.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế không thực hiện sáp nhập.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"General Resolution\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thông tin về việc đổi tên, chia tách, sáp nhập Phường Thuỷ Xuân không được cung cấp trong các nghị quyết.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      },\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Huế\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  ]\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n}\\\\\\\"\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
