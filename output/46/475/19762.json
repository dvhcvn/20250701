  "thought": "**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change in Huế**\n\nOkay, so I've been tasked with pinpointing the new administrative unit for the old address \"Phường Thuận Hòa, Quận Phú Xuân, Thành phố Huế.\"  My approach is pretty standard for these cases: a methodical scan through the resolutions, cross-referencing with the \"New Wards\" list, and a careful check for any ambiguities.\n\nFirst, I established the context: we're dealing with \"Thành phố Huế,\" so I know the province.  I checked resolution 60-NQ/TW to see if Huế was subject to province-level reorganizations; thankfully, it's not.  That simplifies things considerably.\n\nNext, I zeroed in on the resolutions specific to \"Thành phố Huế,\" looking for mentions of \"Thuận Hòa.\" Resolution `1675/NQ-UBTVQH15` immediately caught my eye. Line 10 of that resolution is the key: it clearly states that \"Phường Thuận Hòa\" is merged with several other wards to form the new ward called \"**phường Phú Xuân**.\"  Bingo! That’s the answer I was looking for.\n\nI then went through the \"New Wards\" list and confirmed the information.  There's a direct match:  `{\"ward_code\":\"19753\",\"ward_name\":\"Phường Phú Xuân\",\"province_name\":\"Thành phố Huế\"}`.  That solidifies my conclusion.  I checked the similar sounding \"Phường Thuận Hóa\" which was created in the same resolution but from different wards, and while it's a new ward, it's not relevant to my task since \"Thuận Hòa\" was merged into \"Phú Xuân\".\n\nJust to be thorough, I quickly checked the other resolutions for other places named \"Thuận Hòa\" and confirmed none of those are related to the input address.\n\nTherefore, my final analysis is that \"Phường Thuận Hòa\" in \"Thành phố Huế\" is now part of the new \"Phường Phú Xuân\" according to resolution `1675/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  The province name remains unchanged.  The confidence in this finding is high, since this resolution provides a direct and explicit statement of the merger.  I've got a ward code of 19753 for the new \"Phường Phú Xuân.\" It's good to go.\n",
