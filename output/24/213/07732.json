  "thought": "**Deconstructing the Administrative Mapping Task**\n\nOkay, I've got it. The user wants me to map an old administrative unit, \"Xã Nham Sơn, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang,\" to a new one, based on the provided resolutions. My understanding is that I need to find the new \"ward(s)\" that currently include \"Xã Nham Sơn\". I'm given province-level resolution `60-NQ/TW` and some ward-level resolutions like `1658/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Bắc Ninh and `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15` for Lâm Đồng, plus a list of new wards. I also understand that I need to output the result in a JSON format that provides the citation, confidence (high or low), the province name, the new ward code and name.\n\nI'll start by analyzing the old ward's province. I know that \"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\" has been restructured.  `60-NQ/TW` explicitly states that \"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\" is now part of the new \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\".  That's key; any matching new ward must be within Bắc Ninh.\n\nNext, I'll need to pore through the ward-level resolutions. I'll examine `1658/NQ-UBTVQH15` since it concerns Bắc Ninh. This seems like the right place to look.  The header indeed mentions Bắc Ninh. But, unfortunately, when I dig into the resolution, it lists a bunch of ward mergers into a new \"Phường Bắc Giang.\" However, \"Xã Nham Sơn\" isn't mentioned there. Looking at resolution `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15`  is a waste of time as it pertains to Lâm Đồng, a completely irrelevant province.\n\nSince I have no solid information, my conclusion is that the province change is clear, but finding the exact new unit where Nham Son is located is difficult because no relevant documents are provided. I'm left without sufficient information to confidently map \"Xã Nham Sơn\" to a new ward. The prompt tells me to say confidence is low if I'm not sure. So, the right action is to respond with an empty JSON array because I can't find a definitive mapping based on the available documents.\n",

Standard stuff.\\n\\nNow, the crucial step: I dove into those Province Resolutions, specifically 60-NQ/TW.  Bingo! It clearly states the merger of \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\" with \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\" to form, well, \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\" That's the key.\\n\\nNext, I turned my attention to the user-provided resolutions, hoping for details on changes to wards and districts.  I had to go through them one by one.  First up was **Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15**, which focused on reorganizing wards *within* the new province of Bắc Ninh. Line 92 mentions the consolidation of several wards, including Thọ Xương, Ngô Quyền, etc., into a *new* ward called \\\"phường Bắc Giang.\\\" But, crucially, \\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\" wasn't mentioned *anywhere*. My concern began to grow.\\n\\nThe other resolution, **1671/NQ-UBTVQH15**, was irrelevant since it was for Lâm Đồng.\\n\\nSo, here's the reality check: I know for sure the old province is now Bắc Ninh. However, I can't confirm any changes to \\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\" in the given documents. I found the merger of the old wards into \\\"phường Bắc Giang\\\" in the document, but it did not provide clarity about my target ward. It would be my assumption that \\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\" is still located within \\\"Thành phố Bắc Giang.\\\" I do not have evidence to say otherwise.\\n\\nTherefore, my final conclusion has to be \\\"low confidence.\\\" I can absolutely confirm the new province is \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\" but I *cannot* definitively determine what happened to \\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\". It remains uncertain.\\n\\nThe only reasonable output is a JSON object confirming the province and indicating that the rest remains unknown:  `[{\\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\", \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\"}]`. I'll omit any ward details since I don't have sufficient information.  That's the most responsible and accurate response I can give based on this dataset.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Nham Sơn, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 8635,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0027803,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Reorganization in Bắc Giang**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, so I'm tasked with mapping the old address \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" to its new administrative equivalent based on the provided resolutions and new ward data. It looks like a straightforward exercise in cross-referencing and logical deduction.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the components:  \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" (the province), \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\" (the old *commune*), and \\\\\\\"Thành phố Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" (the *city*).  I noted that \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn,\\\\\\\" although technically a commune, is being treated as a \\\\\\\"ward\\\\\\\" for this mapping purpose, which is fine, I can work with that.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I examined the resolutions. I immediately saw that Resolution 60-NQ/TW merged \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" into \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\" Therefore, the new `province_name` is definitely \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\" That's easy.\\\\n\\\\nNow for the tricky part: \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn.\\\\\\\" I meticulously checked the relevant resolutions, particularly 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with restructuring units within Thành phố Bắc Giang. I noticed that this resolution creates a new \\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" from *existing* wards within the old city. Crucially, \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\" wasn't listed among those merged wards. So, there's no direct indication that it became part of this new \\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nI then went through the \\\\\\\"new wards\\\\\\\" data.  While I found \\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang,\\\\\\\" it's clearly the result of merging those *other* wards I mentioned.  There's also \\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Vân,\\\\\\\" but there's absolutely no connection mentioned between \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\" and this new commune.\\\\n\\\\nGiven the available information, I'm forced to conclude that \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\" is *not* explicitly mentioned as being merged or renamed. The resolution pertaining to its province has changed it to \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\". The \\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" is made up of other wards, and other than that, no data directly links \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\" to any new ward, and I have found no information indicating its new name or location. It could have been merged, but this data does not support such a conclusion. I need to be *sure*, and I can't make assumptions.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"citation\\\": {\\n        \\\"header\\\": \\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\",\\n        \\\"line\\\": \\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Bắc Ninh và tỉnh Bắc Giang, lấy tên là tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\"\\n      },\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 7162,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0027803,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Navigating the Reorganization of Bắc Giang Province**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm tackling this address mapping problem, aiming to translate \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" into its new administrative structure. The key is to leverage these resolutions and the new ward data.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, the easy part:  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is clearly merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" according to resolution 60-NQ/TW.  So, we're looking at a new province name of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  That's straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe tricky bit is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". I need to find its new equivalent. My understanding is that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a *commune* but for this specific mapping I'm treating it like a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ward\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as it fits the schema.  I've gone through the relevant resolutions meticulously, focusing on those concerning Bắc Ninh and Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nResolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one about the merger within the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", seemed promising, creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". However, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wasn't listed among the wards that contributed to the new ward.  This is a significant roadblock.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI've also checked the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data against \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", looking for any connections, like the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Vân\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Tỉnh Bắc Ninh. No luck there either.  I was hoping for a direct mention or a logical link between \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and one of these new entities, but there's nothing.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nIn summary, I can confidently change the province to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" due to the province-level merger. But based on the information provided, I **cannot** definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Nham Sơn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a specific new ward. There's simply no evidence indicating what happened to it after the reorganization. I need more information to make a precise mapping at this stage.  I'd need to consult additional sources or possibly explore how communes are handled in the reorganization process.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Bắc Ninh và tỉnh Bắc Giang, lấy tên là tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ]\\\\n}\\\"\\n}\"\n}"
