  "thought": "**My Analysis of Mapping Old Administrative Unit**\n\nOkay, here's the breakdown of my thought process in tackling this mapping problem. The user's given me an old ward, \"Xã Thắng Cương\" in \"Thành phố Bắc Giang,\" which was in \"Tỉnh Bắc Giang.\" My job is to find its new equivalent based on these provided resolutions.\n\nFirst, I identified the key information: the old ward, district, and province. Then, I dug into the \"Province Resolutions\" (60-NQ/TW).  I quickly figured out that \"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\" is now part of \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\" based on the \"merged\" list. That narrows things down.\n\nNext, I analyzed the resolutions provided, focusing on any mention of \"Xã Thắng Cương\" or \"Thành phố Bắc Giang.\" \"Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Bắc Ninh)\" seemed promising. It described the creation of \"Phường Bắc Giang\" from several wards in the old \"Thành phố Bắc Giang.\" I hoped to find \"Xã Thắng Cương\" here, but unfortunately, it wasn't mentioned. That was a significant hurdle. Other resolutions were irrelevant, pointing me back to the North Ninh direction.\n\nI then consulted the list of \"New Wards.\" I found two in \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\" \"Phường Bắc Giang\" was created by the resolution I'd been examining, and \"Xã Hoàng Vân\" also exists.\n\nSynthesizing all the information, the situation is tricky. While I know \"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\" became part of \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh,\" I can't definitively match \"Xã Thắng Cương\" to a specific new ward based solely on the provided text. However, the connection to \"Phường Bắc Giang\" is compelling. It was created from wards in the *same* old city (\"Thành phố Bắc Giang\"). Considering the question that districts may be eliminated, and the old unit was \"Xã Thắng Cương, Thành phố Bắc Giang\", I reasoned that these units within Thành phố Bắc Giang were merged or rearranged, so it's a plausible guess that \"Xã Thắng Cương\" became part of this new \"Phường Bắc Giang\" unit, even if the resolution doesn't explicitly state it.\n\n\"Xã Hoàng Vân\" is also an option, but there's no connection to the old city; there is less evidence. Thus, I'll output \"Phường Bắc Giang\" as the most likely candidate. I'll include the \"low\" confidence level because of the lack of explicit confirmation. I'll cite the resolution that created \"Phường Bắc Giang\" and the province merger document. The question asked for one or multiple, I considered the single option best, given the lack of evidence of other connections. I think this is a logical, albeit cautious, response given the limitations of the input.\n",

My initial assessment is that the provided resolutions and context are insufficient for a *definitive* mapping.\\n\\nHere's the breakdown of my thought process:\\n\\nFirst, I established the provincial context. I confirmed that the old `Tỉnh Bắc Giang` has merged into the new `Tỉnh Bắc Ninh`, which is crucial.  This also means the old `Thành phố Bắc Giang` is now part of the new `Tỉnh Bắc Ninh`.\\n\\nNow for the tricky part: mapping the specific ward, `Xã Thắng Cương`. I focused on the relevant resolution, 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning `Tỉnh Bắc Ninh`. This resolution mentions merging several wards from the old `Thành phố Bắc Giang` into a new `Phường Bắc Giang`. I carefully checked to see if `Thắng Cương` was included in the list of wards being merged (Thọ Xương, Ngô Quyền, Xương Giang, Hoàng Văn Thụ, Trần Phú, Dĩnh Kế, Dĩnh Trì).  Unfortunately, `Xã Thắng Cương` is conspicuously absent.\\n\\nI exhaustively scanned the provided resolutions, but found no other mentions of `Thắng Cương`.  While the user specifically asked for *all possible candidates*, this is a critical point: I need to work with *facts*.  It is **possible** `Xã Thắng Cương` was part of a different restructuring, or incorporated in another way. It might have been involved in some capacity with the new `Phường Bắc Giang`, or perhaps it's now part of a completely new ward. But the *given information* doesn't provide any concrete evidence to support that. The name isn't phonetically similar to any of the new ward names.\\n\\nI can only conclude that based on the evidence, I can't confidently map `Xã Thắng Cương` to a specific new ward.  The data is incomplete, and I can't speculate. The best I can do is point out the potential for further investigation needed within this context.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Thắng Cương, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 16232,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0030158,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Processing the Mapping Request for \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\"**\\\\n\\\\nOkay, let's break this down. I need to figure out the new administrative unit(s) that correspond to the old ward \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương,\\\\\\\" located in \\\\\\\"Thành phố Bắc Giang,\\\\\\\" within \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang,\\\\\\\" based on these resolutions. The output needs to be in JSON, following that specific schema. I'll need to indicate a confidence level, especially if the data is shaky.  I need to also cite the source resolutions.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the key information about \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\": its name, district/city, and province. Then, I dug into the provided resolutions, starting with the provincial ones.  I immediately noted the critical piece of information: \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" no longer exists; it was merged with \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\" That's a huge shift.\\\\n\\\\nNext, I needed to analyze the ward-level resolutions. I meticulously scanned for any mention of \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Thành phố Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\" I found Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, concerning \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\" This looked promising. It detailed the merging of various wards into the new \\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\" However, \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\" wasn't listed among them! The other resolutions were irrelevant to the old \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSynthesizing this, I'm stuck. \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" is now part of \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh,\\\\\\\" but none of the provided resolutions explicitly map \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\" to a new ward. Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 *does* create \\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" from *other* wards, making it unlikely to be the correct mapping for \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương.\\\\\\\" It also adds the ward \\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Vân\\\\\\\".  I also saw the provided list of new wards: \\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang\\\\\\\" (ward_code: 07210, province_name: Tỉnh Bắc Ninh) and \\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Vân\\\\\\\" (ward_code: 07822, province_name: Tỉnh Bắc Ninh).\\\\n\\\\nWithout further information, I simply *cannot* say definitively where \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\" is now. I might need more resolutions, or maybe that ward kept its name, was merged with a ward not included in the documents I have, or was merged into \\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Vân.\\\\\\\" Therefore, the confidence level here is 'low'. There's just not enough data to be certain.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 13199,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0027133,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**Navigating the Administrative Unit Landscape**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, so the user wants me to pinpoint the updated administrative unit for the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  My initial approach is to break this down.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to understand the old address structure. We have \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (District), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (Province).\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I'm checking for any province-level changes.  My source, the `60-NQ/TW` resolution, states that Bắc Giang merged with Bắc Ninh, becoming \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  So, that part's straightforward – \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, for the tricky part: ward and district-level adjustments. I've got a handful of resolutions to sift through: `1658/NQ-UBTVQH15`, `1671/NQ-UBTVQH15`, and `1672/NQ-UBTVQH15`.  `1671` and `1672` are for Lâm Đồng and Lạng Sơn, respectively, so I can ignore those.  `1658`, however, looks promising as it deals with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" – the very province Bắc Giang became.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nDiving into `1658`, I find line 92, which details the formation of a new ward called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  It mentions merging several wards from what was likely the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to create this new entity.  Here's where the problem arises: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *isn't* explicitly listed among the wards being merged to form \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nLooking at the new ward list it confirms that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" now exists within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but the information provided in the resolutions is incomplete.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nMy analysis so far tells me that the old province is now part of Bắc Ninh. However, I have no definitive information on how \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was incorporated. It's possible it's now part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" because it's in the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thành phố Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", but this is not listed in the provided information.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nI can't be certain. The resolutions don't explicitly state what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" It's merged into an unseen unit, or it's still operating the same, just under the new code name. The data's just not there.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nBased on this, I need more data to provide a conclusive answer.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"07210\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 8444,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0030082999999999998,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**My Analysis of the Administrative Unit Change for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm looking at how to map the old address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương, Thành phố Bắc Giang, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to its new administrative unit. First, I need to break down the information: the province is Tỉnh Bắc Giang, the ward is Xã Thắng Cương, and the district-level unit is Thành phố Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nMy initial thought is to check the relevant resolutions. I know there's been some merging and reorganization in the area. The first resolution, 60-NQ/TW, is pretty clear: it says that Tỉnh Bắc Giang is now part of Tỉnh Bắc Ninh. So, right away, I can confidently say the new province for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will be Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNext, I need to see what happened to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" itself. I have resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 to examine. It outlines the restructuring of wards *within* Thành phố Bắc Giang. But, importantly, it only lists specific phường (urban wards) that are merged to form Phường Bắc Giang. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is not mentioned.  This suggests that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" might not be directly impacted by this particular resolution, or at least not in a way that I can determine from the provided data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI quickly rule out 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15 and 1672/NQ-UBTVQH15, as they deal with Lâm Đồng and Lạng Sơn, respectively, and are irrelevant here.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then check the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data. I see Phường Bắc Giang created from a list of *phường*s, which is not applicable to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", since it's a *xã*. There is also \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Vân\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in Tỉnh Bắc Ninh, but there's no provided information that shows it was formed by incorporating Xã Thắng Cương.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe data indicates that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" now belongs to Tỉnh Bắc Ninh, but it doesn't offer a definitive answer on which specific new ward it belongs to. My conclusion is that while the province has changed, and Thành phố Bắc Giang is now part of Tỉnh Bắc Ninh, further investigation or data is needed to clarify the specific fate and new identification of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"5.

Resolution 60-NQ/TW tells me that Tỉnh Bắc Giang is now part of Tỉnh Bắc Ninh. That's straightforward. So, the new province will be Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow for the ward. I need to sift through the provided resolutions. Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 details the reorganization of wards within Thành phố Bắc Giang. However, it specifically lists the wards involved in creating \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is *not* on that list. This is a crucial point. It's a xã, and the resolution is focused on phường, so that's a key distinction.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe other resolutions, 1671/NQ-UBTVQH15 and 1672/NQ-UBTVQH15, are irrelevant because they pertain to completely different provinces (Lâm Đồng and Lạng Sơn, respectively).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nLooking at the provided new ward data, I see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Phường Bắc Giang,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which seems promising at first, given the previous resolution. However, as noted, this phường is formed from a specific set of existing phường, and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't appear in that list. Then there's \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Hoàng Vân,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" also in Tỉnh Bắc Ninh, but there's no resolution that explains its formation or if \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was incorporated into it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nTherefore, considering the information available, I can confirm that the province is now \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, I *cannot* definitively determine the new ward for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Thắng Cương\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on these resolutions and data. The resolutions don't explicitly mention it. I need more information to accurately pinpoint its new administrative designation, if any. Perhaps there is a specific resolution detailing the reorganization of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" units that I don't have.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"5.
