  "thought": "**Administrative Unit Transformation: Xã Kiên Lao**\n\nAlright, let's break this down. My goal is to pinpoint the current administrative unit for the former \"Xã Kiên Lao, Thị xã Chũ, Tỉnh Bắc Giang.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the current provincial landscape. The initial input clearly identifies the ward, district, and province. Given my expertise, I know about the recent provincial re-organizations. Specifically, I recall the merging of Bắc Giang with Bắc Ninh. Thus, the new administrative unit for \"Xã Kiên Lao\" *must* reside within the \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\" now.\n\nMy strategy involves scrutinizing relevant resolutions. I'll systematically review each resolution, looking for any references to \"Kiên Lao.\"  After checking various resolutions, I found a match in Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, specific to Bắc Ninh. Line 37 of this resolution states that the merging of \"xã Kiên Thành\" and \"xã Kiên Lao\" results in a brand new \"Xã Kiên Lao.\" That's the key. This resolution definitively addresses the administrative change I'm investigating.\n\nTo complete the picture, I'll use the `New wards` list to obtain the corresponding `ward_code`. Searching for the correct `ward_name` and `province_name` within the list gives me `{\"ward_code\":\"07552\",\"ward_name\":\"Xã Kiên Lao\",\"province_name\":\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\"}`.\n\nSo, the new administrative unit is \"Xã Kiên Lao\" in \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\", with a `ward_code` of \"07552\". The evidence is robust, and the citation is clear.  The high confidence in this determination stems from the explicit nature of the ward re-organization as detailed in the relevant legislative resolution. The old district is not explicitly stated in the results, but the reference to \"phường Chũ\" in line 86 of the same resolution confirms the context is correct.\n",

The user's asking about \\\"Xã Kiên Lao, Thị xã Chũ, Tỉnh Bắc Giang.\\\" That requires me to find the new administrative unit after the recent reshuffling.  I'll start by analyzing the components: \\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\" is the ward, \\\"Thị xã Chũ\\\" (Chũ Town) is the district-level unit, and \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\" is the province.\\n\\nFirst, I know that Bắc Giang has merged. I need to figure out which province it's part of now. I checked the provincial resolutions (specifically 60-NQ/TW), and it looks like Bắc Giang merged with Bắc Ninh, becoming \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\" That's the key shift.\\n\\nNow, I need to investigate the ward-level changes within \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\" My focus is on the resolutions that apply to that province. I quickly scan the resolution headers to identify the relevant ones (like 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15).\\n\\nDeep diving into resolution 1658, I search for \\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\" and \\\"Thị xã Chũ.\\\" Line 37 is a direct hit: \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của xã Kiên Thành và xã Kiên Lao thành xã mới có tên gọi là **xã Kiên Lao**.\\\" Bingo! The old Kiên Lao was merged with Kiên Thành, but the new ward retains the name \\\"Kiên Lao.\\\" That's a strong candidate.\\n\\nFurther down, line 86 says that Thanh Hai, Hong Giang, Tru Huu, and Chu (the old township) were merged into a new Chũ ward:  \\\"Sắp xếp toàn bộ diện tích tự nhiên, quy mô dân số của các phường Thanh Hải, Hồng Giang, Trù Hựu và Chũ thành phường mới có tên gọi là **phường Chũ**.\\\" So, the old Thị xã Chũ is still relevant, now as Phường Chũ.\\n\\nFinally, I need to check my work. I'll cross-reference my findings with the \\\"new wards\\\" list, comparing the identified ward names with Tỉnh Bắc Ninh. I find \\\"xã Kiên Lao\\\" has ward code 07552, and the new \\\"phường Chũ\\\" has ward code 07525, both confirmed within Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\n\\nThe conclusion is strong. The original address is contained within the new ward of Xã Kiên Lao or the new Phường Chũ, now under the administrative framework of Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"citation\": {\n        \"header\": \"1658/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Bắc Ninh\",\n        \"line\": \"37.

The user's query focuses on updating the address \\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao, Thị xã Chũ, Tỉnh Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\" My first step, as always, is to navigate the relevant resolutions and consider the hierarchy of administrative units.\\\\n\\\\nFirst, I identified the provincial change. Resolution 60-NQ/TW states that Bắc Giang was merged into Bắc Ninh. This means the province is now Bắc Ninh. Easy enough.\\\\n\\\\nNow, the real work begins with pinpointing the specific changes impacting \\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ.\\\\\\\" I'm diving into Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, the one focused on commune-level administrative unit changes within Bắc Ninh.\\\\n\\\\nHere's what I've found:\\\\n\\\\n*   **Xã Kiên Lao:** The resolution clearly states that the old \\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\" has been merged with \\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Thành\\\\\\\" to form a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao.\\\\\\\" The name is retained, but the composition has changed.\\\\n*   **Thị xã Chũ / Chũ:** This is where it gets interesting. Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 also mentions \\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\" in the context of creating a new \\\\\\\"phường Chũ\\\\\\\" from several wards. It seems that \\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\" either *is* the name of a ward in the town, or it is a broader term encompassing \\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nThe problem is that the original address mixes commune-level (\\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\") with a town/district-level (\\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ\\\\\\\"). Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 deals exclusively with commune-level reorganizations. However, the mention of \\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\" in the context of creating a *phường* suggests it might represent a central ward or a commune within \\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\n**My current understanding of the new structure is as follows:**\\\\n\\\\nThe old \\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\" is now a *new* \\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao,\\\\\\\" likely a larger entity due to the merger with Kiên Thành. \\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ\\\\\\\" is still relevant, although it seems \\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\" might refer to a specific ward or commune being reorganized into \\\\\\\"phường Chũ.\\\\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nTo accurately pinpoint the new address, I'll need more information regarding the status of the \\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ\\\\\\\".

This sets the stage for the specific changes within the old province's boundaries.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm diving into Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, which deals with restructuring commune-level units within Bắc Ninh. This is where things get interesting.  I found that the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged with \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Thành,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" but the new entity retains the name \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" That part's relatively straightforward.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe bigger challenge is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Resolution 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 mentions \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the context of creating a new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" through the merger of multiple wards, which includes something called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". The resolution explicitly indicates that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is being merged into the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". This implies that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is either the town itself or a specific administrative division within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and is being reorganized into a ward-level unit.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThe key here is recognizing the hierarchical levels.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a commune, while \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a town.  The resolution primarily addresses *commune-level* changes.  While it doesn't explicitly describe the fate of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" *as a whole*, it *does* outline how \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (presumably a ward within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\") is being integrated into a new ward (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\").  The fact that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has become a ward means the town *probably* has been reorganized or re-delineated.\\\\\\\\nThis means that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" will now be part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" because it has been absorbed and is a lower level than the original \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Thị xã Chũ.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\nIn essence, the given address \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao, Thị xã Chũ, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has the old \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"phường Chũ\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Hợp nhất tỉnh Bắc Ninh và tỉnh Bắc Giang, lấy tên là tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\"\\\\n      },\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"high\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"07552\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Kiên Lao\\\\\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\": {\\\\n        \\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"1658/NQ-UBTVQH15: Sắp xếp các đơn vị hành chính cấp xã của tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\",\\\\n        \\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"37.
