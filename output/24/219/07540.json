  "thought": "**Processing the Request: Xã Xa Lý Mapping**\n\nOkay, here's my thought process. I need to figure out the new location for \"Xã Xa Lý, Huyện Lục Ngạn, Tỉnh Bắc Giang.\" I'll start by breaking down the request: old ward, task (find the new one), sources (resolutions), output format (JSON), and the need for a confidence level if I'm unsure, plus citations where possible.\n\nFirst, I analyze the old ward: it's in Bắc Giang. Now, I have to look at those province resolutions. I found that Bắc Giang was merged with Bắc Ninh (60-NQ/TW). So \"Xã Xa Lý\" is now in Bắc Ninh.\n\nNext, I sift through the resolutions, focusing on those about Bắc Ninh since that's the new province. I found 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, a resolution for Bắc Ninh. It mentions a \"xã Lục Ngạn\". And it does list communes involved in a merger, but sadly, \"Xã Xa Lý\" isn't mentioned in that provided excerpt.\n\nSo I look at the other provided resolution, 1655/NQ-UBTVQH15 for Cà Mau, which is not applicable. 1657/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Cao Bằng) and 1674/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Ninh Bình) and 1680/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Quảng Trị) and 1685/NQ-UBTVQH15 (TP. Hồ Chí Minh) are not applicable either.\n\nNow, here's the issue.  I have \"Xã Lục Ngạn\" in the list of new wards, and it's a very plausible candidate. The old ward was in Lục Ngạn district, and this new ward has the exact same district name!  But the evidence isn't perfect, because the provided text *doesn't* explicitly list \"Xã Xa Lý\" as being part of this new \"Xã Lục Ngạn.\"  The only line in the resolution text references the merger of a different group of villages to create \"Xã Lục Ngạn\". So, it's very likely, but I can't be 100% certain from the information provided. I should not try to cite the resolution, since the resolution text provided does not mention \"Xã Xa Lý\".\n\nThe provided new ward list also has \"Xã Sơn Động\" in Bắc Ninh. However, the existing evidence is not strong enough to state that is accurate.\n\nTherefore, my final JSON array will only include \"Xã Lục Ngạn\" in \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\" and with \"low\" confidence, because while it's the strongest candidate, I cannot find explicit confirmation from the provided resolution texts.  I'll omit any citation, since there's no direct support from the provided resolution text. The province merger confirms that the area is now in Bắc Ninh.\n",

Based on the province merger, \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\" is now \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\" That's easy enough. Now, the trickier part is the ward itself. The old district was \\\"Huyện Lục Ngạn,\\\" which provides a strong clue.\\n\\nI've examined the provided resolutions and 1658/NQ-UBTVQH15, specifically concerning Bắc Ninh, seems relevant. It describes the creation of a new \\\"xã Lục Ngạn.\\\"  This is a good sign, because it shares the name of the old district.  However, while the resolution lists some units being merged into this new \\\"xã Lục Ngạn,\\\" \\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned. This means it could be part of this new \\\"xã Lục Ngạn\\\" or maybe another, incomplete list of merged wards.\\n\\nI also see a list of new wards, and one of them,  `{\\\"ward_code\\\":\\\"07582\\\",\\\"ward_name\\\":\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\",\\\"province_name\\\":\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\"}`, looks particularly promising. It's in the correct province, and the name matches the old district!  The fact that a new ward shares the same name as the old district often indicates that most, if not all, of the wards from that district are being consolidated into the new unit. The snippet of the resolution is a little concerning. We only see 5 old units. Is the full list missing?\\n\\nThe other possibility is `{\\\"ward_code\\\":\\\"07615\\\",\\\"ward_name\\\":\\\"Xã Sơn Động\\\",\\\"province_name\\\":\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\"}`. Since Sơn Động was in the old Bắc Giang province too, it's a possibility, but I have no evidence to link Xã Xa Lý to Sơn Động.\\n\\nConsidering all the information, even though the text isn't explicit, my best educated guess is that the new administrative unit for \\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\" is indeed \\\"Xã Lục Ngạn, Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\" It fits the pattern and makes the most logical sense given the limited information. This requires verifying it against another reliable source.\\n\",\n  \"result\": [\n    {\n      \"confidence\": \"low\",\n      \"province_name\": \"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\",\n      \"ward_code\": \"07582\",\n      \"ward_name\": \"Xã Lục Ngạn\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"previousResult\": \"{\\n  \\\"address\\\": \\\"Xã Xa Lý, Huyện Lục Ngạn, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\",\\n  \\\"ellapsedInMs\\\": 15321,\\n  \\\"estimatedCost\\\": 0.0033469000000000003,\\n  \\\"thought\\\": \\\"**Analyzing the Administrative Shift of \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\"**\\\\n\\\\nMy initial task is to locate the new administrative unit corresponding to the old ward \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý, Huyện Lục Ngạn, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\".  I start by breaking down the components: the ward itself, the district, and the province.  I know immediately that the province, \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang,\\\\\\\" has been restructured, so that's my primary focus.\\\\n\\\\nThe initial analysis of Province Resolutions (60-NQ/TW) reveals the merger of Bắc Giang and Bắc Ninh to form \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\" Consequently, my search for \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\" shifts to this new province.  I then need to analyze all relevant resolutions to find a definitive answer about where \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\" has been reassigned or merged.\\\\n\\\\nScanning through the provided resolutions, I eliminate those concerning provinces unrelated to Bắc Giang or Bắc Ninh (Cà Mau, Cao Bằng).  Resolution **1658/NQ-UBTVQH15 (Bắc Ninh)** warrants further investigation. This resolution outlines the formation of a new \\\\\\\"xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\" and is potentially relevant because it consolidates several wards from the old \\\\\\\"Huyện Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\" (the district containing \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\").  However, a careful review reveals that \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\" is *not* explicitly mentioned among the constituent wards used to create the new \\\\\\\"xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\".\\\\n\\\\nI then move on to analyzing the list of new wards.  There's a \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\" in \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\" – a strong possibility, but I've already established that \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\" was not listed in the formation of this ward. I see another ward, \\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Động\\\\\\\" in Bắc Ninh, but this doesn't offer direct evidence either. All the other new wards are in unrelated provinces.\\\\n\\\\nThe inherent complexities arise as I piece together the available information.  It is stated that all districts are eliminated, which would suggest an extensive redrawing of ward boundaries. \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\" is a good candidate because it matches the old district name, and it is a newly formed, larger ward. While \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly listed in the formation of this new ward, given the complete restructuring and the information about eliminated districts, it is plausible that it has been included, and the resolution text I have may be incomplete. I need to make the inference that given the merger, \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\" from the former \\\\\\\"Huyện Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\" almost certainly had to have been merged into *something*, and \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\" is the most likely candidate.\\\\n\\\",\\n  \\\"result\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"confidence\\\": \\\"low\\\",\\n      \\\"province_name\\\": \\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_code\\\": \\\"07582\\\",\\n      \\\"ward_name\\\": \\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"previousResult\\\": \\\"{\\\\n  \\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý, Huyện Lục Ngạn, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\": 15202,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\": 0.0029369,\\\\n  \\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"**My Assessment of the Administrative Reorganization**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nOkay, here's what I've figured out, putting it together based on my understanding of these types of reorganizations.  The user wants the new administrative unit for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý, Huyện Lục Ngạn, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".  Here's my thought process:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFirst, I broke down the address:  We have \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the ward), \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the district), and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (the province).  That's my starting point.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nNext, I immediately jumped to provincial changes based on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" resolutions. I found that Bắc Giang *merged* with Bắc Ninh, becoming simply \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  That's a pretty straightforward change.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThen, the focus shifted to finding the relevant resolutions concerning *ward* changes within that new province. The list of provided resolutions pointed me toward `1658/NQ-UBTVQH15`, which seems to be the key for Bắc Ninh.  I dug into its text.  The important line is where it describes the creation of a *new* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lục Ngạn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which matches the district name.  That's a strong indicator.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nHowever, and this is where it gets tricky, the resolution **does not** explicitly mention \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as one of the constituent units contributing to the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\". That omission is a bit of a red flag. I'm noting that the *old* district, Huyện Lục Ngạn, is now the *name* of the *new* ward. That's a good sign, and it's quite common for this type of reorganization.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nTo further clarify, I consulted the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New Wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list. I found \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" listed as a new ward within Tỉnh Bắc Ninh. This supports my belief that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" might now be part of this new, consolidated \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I also see \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Sơn Động\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" listed as a new ward. However, this old district isn't in my initial address, so it's irrelevant.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nSo here's the challenge. I have a *strong inclination* that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is now part of the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the new province. It's the most *likely* scenario given the district's name association and the new ward listing.  **However, the lack of explicit confirmation in the resolution creates uncertainty.**  I can't say with absolute certainty without more information. There may be some additional documentation to consider that could clarify the precise composition of the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My confidence level is high but not absolute, given this missing piece. I need to be transparent about this potential ambiguity.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\",\\\\n  \\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \\\\\\\"confidence\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"low\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"province_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_code\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"07582\\\\\\\",\\\\n      \\\\\\\"ward_name\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ],\\\\n  \\\\\\\"previousResult\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"{\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"address\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý, Huyện Lục Ngạn, Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ellapsedInMs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 7676,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"estimatedCost\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": 0.0031744,\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"thought\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**Assessing the Administrative Shift for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nOkay, so I'm presented with the task of pinpointing the new administrative designation for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý, Huyện Lục Ngạn, Tỉnh Bắc Giang.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This requires a careful navigation of the relevant resolutions and the new ward data, especially given the significant administrative changes occurring.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I had to clarify the province change. It's clear that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been absorbed into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" based on the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" document. So, the relevant context shifts to \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, I'm zeroing in on \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" within the newly formed \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  My primary source is \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1658/NQ-UBTVQH15,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" which addresses administrative realignments within that province.  This resolution highlights the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" formed from specific old wards.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nCrucially, though, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned as one of the contributing wards to the new \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"  This is a significant roadblock. The problem states that most wards have been renamed or merged, but \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" doesn't appear in the documentation regarding \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn's\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" formation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI then check the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" list for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", which includes \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" (as per the resolution). However, because \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" wasn't listed, I cannot confidently say that it's now part of this new ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThe absence of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" in the relevant resolutions creates some uncertainty. It could imply one of several possibilities: a different merger, a renaming, or remaining unchanged (unlikely, given the prompt).  Since the information is incomplete in this particular instance, my confidence in definitively mapping \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a specific new ward is inherently low.

My initial thought process is to break this down systematically.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFirst, I need to identify any provincial changes. Looking at the provided resolutions, specifically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" I find that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Giang\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been merged into \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This is a straightforward start.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nNow, focusing on the core of the problem, I need to find where \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" fit into the new structure of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" My attention turns to the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Other resolutions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" for \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh,\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" and specifically \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"1658/NQ-UBTVQH15.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" This resolution mentions the creation of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" from a combination of other wards. However, critically, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't included in the listed components. The old *district* \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Huyện Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is mentioned in the prompt, but it is indicated that all districts are eliminated. Therefore, it may have been incorporated into a new *ward* with the same name.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nI've also checked the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"New wards\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" data. I see that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Lục Ngạn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is indeed listed as a new ward within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Tỉnh Bắc Ninh.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" However, this reinforces the initial problem: \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" isn't explicitly mentioned in its formation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nGiven the information at hand, I'm at a bit of an impasse. The provided data does *not* explicitly list \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" as merging into or being renamed to a new ward. The problem explicitly stated that \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"most\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" of the wards have been renamed. This leaves me with several possibilities:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" was merged into a new ward *not* documented in the provided data.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n2.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" has been renamed, but that renaming isn't reflected in the materials.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n3.  The information is simply incomplete, and doesn't account for this specific ward.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nDue to this uncertainty, I'd have to consider this with a low confidence, because with the available data, I'm unable to definitively map \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Xã Xa Lý\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" to a *new* administrative unit.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"result\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n      \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"citation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": {\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"60-NQ/TW: Các đơn vị hành chính cấp tỉnh mới sau sáp nhập, hợp nhất\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"line\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"5.
